Now-a-days you can earn a custom ability by reaching your first year anniversary, or by purchasing it from the IC shop. So everyone is on the same page, here are the guidelines for custom abilities:
[ul type="circle"]
[li]Staff will message you when you have a custom ability with the approval process. The pm will include these guidelines and a template to use.[/li]
[li]Custom abilities require oneshots, just like special abilities. Basically just introduce yourself using the ability![/li]
[li]They can be applied to a current character or a new character.[/li]
[li]You don't have to redeem these abilities immediately. You can wait as long as you'd like before contacting the staff about claiming it.[/li]
[li]Once an ability is approved and applied to a character, it can't be removed. [/li]
[li]If you drop a character with a custom ability you 'get it back' and can create a new custom ability, but will have to go through the approval process again.[/li]

[li]If proposed ideas are too powerful, we will work with you to water them down, or come up with an alternative that works.[/li]
[li]These are primarily unique abilities (so only one of each), but there may be cases are duplicates are acceptable. Message staff if you'd like to have an ability that is already in use and we will let you know. [/li]
[li]If the character has a special ability or is a demi human you can use a custom ability to acquire a restricted part of the special ability or demihuman skill (example: Vampires can turn into bats but part vampires can't. A part vampire could use their custom ability to gain the skill of turning into a bat.). You can only acquire one skill (using the same example, vampires can also walk on walls. Part vampires can't have both turning into a bat and walking on walls, they can only have one.). In this situation it is not considered a 'custom ability' IC because they are skills that exist. (It is considered a custom ability OOC though.)[/li]
[li]Except for the previous mentioned special ability and demihuman situations, characters with special skills and demihuman status can't have custom abilities.[/li]
[li]Some custom abilities won't work on those trained in occlumency (the ability of mentally guarding yourself and keeping people out of your head/learning things about you.) unless the occlumens intentionally lowers their guard to let it work. As such, abilities state if occlumens are immune.[/li]

[blockquote]Astrid has the ability to manipulate snow and ice using her hands. There is a unique well of magic within her that she taps into when using this power, which is focused through her hands. When the well of power is depleted, exhaustion overtakes her and she will need a restorative sleep and meal. The manipulation is not all powerful - she cannot freeze people or use it too much without depleting the well. Music helps Astrid control this ability and not let it get out of hand, so she will often be found humming while using it. Signs that show Astrid tapping into the power include a faint blue light emanating from her hands and wisps of glowing, bluish steam around snowy/icy bits that she had manipulated. Astrid discovered the power when she was nearly six years old, first displaying itself when her normal magic started to appear. She is capable of producing balls of snow (which she often likes to make into playful snowmen) and icicles, especially when she is angry. The power is tied to her emotions, so in order to conceal her powers, Astrid has managed to internalise and lock away strong feelings, only letting them go when she is certain she can control them.[/blockquote]

[blockquote]Through eye contact he is able to convince someone to preform an action. Eye contact is necessary, his eyes flash a golden color as he uses the ability. He is not able to make someone do something that they wouldn't already do. He also must use soft and direct language. The state doesn't last long, so he must be concise. The weaker the mind the stronger his hold and the longer he can keep it.[/blockquote]

[blockquote]Hazel has the ability to redirect magic, within certain parameters – essentially taking control of the magic and redirecting where it goes without changing the nature of the spell itself. She can only influence single target spells and charms, rather than those intended for multiple targets. The simpler a spell is, the more easily she can redirect it. The more complicated the spell, the harder it becomes, until she reaches a point where the magic won’t obey her at all.[/blockquote]

[blockquote]-doesn't work on occlumens-

It is the inherent ability to find things. Jean was born with an intrinsic, temporary bond to the objects and people he desires to find; from inanimate to blood relatives. If Jean has a sense of the item or a connection to somebody who desires the item, he may be able to locate it. The stronger the connection he has to what he is looking for, the more likely he is to find it. Though it is entirely personal. If Jean does not desire to find something, he will not be able to bond to it. Like an urge, or a tether, he feels a tug in the direction of the item. Using this instinct, Jean can follow it until he can see or acknowledge the object, which is when the bond terminates and he no longer feels the urge to find it any more. It is a very visceral bond when made. Jean can focus on very little else when he is looking for something, or following a tether. It is near impossible to break a bond once made and it can make him physically ill if he cannot discover it - depending on the strength of the bond. For instance, if he was looking for somebody who later died, the bond would be broken without completion and Jean could have a very adverse reaction. It is also not an ability without faults, nor is it entirely exact. Depending on what he is looking for, he may accidentally bond to a relating object or person without realizing it. The bond will still terminate once found, even if it is not exactly what he meant to find. [/blockquote]

[blockquote]Heleen can see magic and with some effort identify what the magic she can see is. This is a slow process that requires a lot of concentration and time, as it is similar to hacking a computer for instance. The more complicated the magic is, the harder this becomes for her, the more risky it becomes and the more time identifying it would consume. She also faces physical repercussions from doing so. From getting tired to bloody noses, and if pushing far beyond her natural limits it can go all the way to more serious complications such as internal bleeding.[/blockquote]

It's basically the same as her father’s except she can actually see the potential connections. She sees a string-like connection that connects potential matches. She can also see strong/deep platonic and familiar relationships. The more noticeable the thread, the deeper the relationship. It ranges from misty grey to pitch black. Like her father she is highly susceptible to vampire/veela allure. She can’t see connections/matches for part humans (vampire/veela/giant/goblin). She also can’t see threads connected to her relatives or herself.[/blockquote]

He has a sixth sense that permits him to sense the ideals of a perfect partner. Jimbo can accurately match them with another person that is deemed to fit. He is basically a one man dating site, where all accounts of people he has listened to are put together and stored, allowing him to pick and choose the perfect partner, for you! While his success rate is extremely high, there are some faults. When put on the spot, he has trouble bringing up a potential partner. Deep, meditative thinking is necessary for a proper decision to be made. Written letters can also take a month or two to process, since he has to understand the feelings that the customer is portraying to him. That's difficult on paper, and thus takes longer. His ability is also completely useless on Christmas, New Year's Eve, during the entire month of February (funny right?), and with influencing magic such as love potions or the Imperius Curse. Demi-humans also give him extreme trouble, and veela and vampire allurement charms slow down his entire process. He is also highly susceptible to their woos.[/blockquote]

[blockquote]Milo has the ability to learn any language, reading, speaking, or hearing. Simply hearing a word, he understands and will never forget it. The more he hears and speaks the more he understands it. The more he learns the better he is with the accents of the language. It can take about a month of study and learning to fully understand a language, along with being able to speak in any language. For reading and writing, he has to first hear the word, but then the understanding simply happens. Learning old or dead languages does prove to be difficult and takes a bit more time, but through learning a language or word once, he will never forget it, even able to recall one he hadn’t used in a long time.

Penelope, when in close proximity to others, has the intuitive sense of whether or not another person has a magical ability outside of the established norms of the wizarding world (i.e. whether or not a person has a custom special ability, rather than something like Legilimency or Occlumency). She cannot, however, tell the nature of the ability or its limitations; she can only tell that a person possesses one, unless that ability has been otherwise shown or explained to her. The more people are around or the greater the physical distance between her and another person, the less likely Penelope is to be able to use her ability.[/blockquote][/div]

[blockquote]Stephen has learned to protect his mind from intrusions to the point that any that try to invade his mind experience physical pain. While designed to be no stronger than a static shock to make one cease their efforts, attempting to push through will feel similar as trying to wade through a wall of thorned plants. While the pain is physical in nature no actual physical harm will come from trying to invade his mind (aka, no bleeding or such).[/blockquote]

She retains the natural affinities druids have with animals but she is also capable of openly communicating and understanding any animal she comes across. It works much like wizards with an animal affinity can, only she is not limited to a species.

Xiulan, unlike other Seers on the site, has an enhanced Inner Eye, such that she can also foresee true prophecies. The vast majority of the time, the prophecies are such that even Xiulan herself cannot decipher them, nor can she say with any certainty how far into the future such a prophecy might occur.

If a player wishes to involve their character in a prophecy or to use a prophecy as a plot element, that prophecy still must be cleared with staff in advance.[/blockquote][/div]

[blockquote]Rhys has the ability to take an object and see some moment in the past relating to that object. For example a photograph could show Rhys when that photograph was taken. He doesn't see a full image but somethin of an echo. So an image that may be mostly sound or mostly visual or strong with one of his other senses, but never all of them. The stronger the emotional connection to the object then the stronger the echo but it will never match a Pensieve quality memory. Using this ability is incredibly draining physically and requires intent to trigger (so not triggered by like accidentally touching an object) so to be used sparingly.[/blockquote][/div]

[blockquote]While druids have an affinity towards nature and a general understanding that is greater than the average witch or wizard, this is the ability to manipulate/utilize/control any part of nature that willingly allows it (to a greater extent than normal spells would). At its simplest, it can be used to encourage a flower to open its petals on an otherwise gloomy day. And at its greatest, a tangle of roots can be called upon to take hold of someone or something, or passage across a perilous swamp can be rendered safe. Fae also finds that her natural affinity as a druid has been bolstered with this as well, increasing her understanding and comprehension of the nature around her.[/blockquote]
