An Animagus is a witch or wizard who can morph him or herself into an animal at will. This is a learned trait and is not hereditary.

[a href="https://www.pottermore.com/features/everything-you-didnt-know-about-animagi"]Everything you didn’t know about Animagi by JK Rowling[/a]

Animagi are witches and wizards who have learned the complex art of transforming into an animal. We’ve been given quite a bit of information on how this intricate form of magic works by JK Rowling, so you can use the above link to read up on them in more detail.

Animagi all have distinguishing features in their animal form to set them apart from normal animals (something that carries over from their human form). And ALL animagi are required to register with the Ministry. Anyone that fails to register and is caught will be sent to Azkaban.

While in animal form, you will have the animal’s ‘natural instincts’ but you are also able to fight it and act the way you desire. But this does make it easier to blend in as a normal animal at times! You will maintain your normal life span and not the animal’s. (Example: Wormtail lived as a rat for 12+ years. Rats do not live that long, so he was aging like a human.)

Legilimens are unable to enter your mind or persuade your thoughts while you are in animal form, nor are they aware of your real identity being human without prior knowledge.

[/a][/div]
We’ve been given quite a bit of information on how one becomes an Animagus. It requires several steps that we’ll briefly cover, as anyone that wishes to play an animagi should know what their character had to go through!

The animal you turn into will be the same as your Patronus (if you wish for it to be different please contact staff for our exceptions to this restriction.) and limited to non magical animals (you can't turn into magical creatures.).
[ul type="circle"]
[li]Keep a Mandrake leaf in their mouth for an entire month (even when eating and sleeping. If it falls out at any time you have to start over.)[/li]
[li]At the next (visible) full moon, the wizard must put their spit-soaked leaf in a phial within range of the moon's pure rays. (If the moon's hiding behind clouds or something you have to start over.)[/li]
[li]In the phial you will also need dew that hasn't been exposed to sunlight or human feet for a full seven days (again… start over if you fail.)[/li]
[li]Keep the potion hidden and out of sunlight. For a while.[/li]
[li]Every day at sunrise and sunset you have to say. "Amato Animo Animato Animagus." (This can go on for days or weeks or months.)[/li]
[li]Wait for an electrical storm. When one finally blows in, get outside, drink the potion and say the incarnation again. You’ll be transformed into your Animal form.[/li]
[li]Go register with the Ministry.[/li]
[/ul]We don’t require characters to go through all of this in character, but if you want to have an existing character start to learn how to become an Animagi it could be fun and interesting to roleplay all of this out! It’s entirely up to you.

Individuals with this ability have an affinity for animals of a certain type. They can easily understand some thoughts and feelings of the animal they are more connected to. Understanding and being able to communicate with animals of your affinity does give you a higher skill to control/train/tame/etc these animals then a non-affinity person. Individuals may only have one type of animal. (Example, you can have an affinity toward all dogs or all felines but not both.) You are also limited to Non-magical or Magical. (Example, you can have a dragon affinity but it does not permit you to understand lizards and vice versa.)

[div align="center"]cannot be combined with demihumans[/div]

Clairvoyants are magical individuals with a heightened 'inner eye', that makes them more sensitive to the magic of the world and permits them to see things the normal witch/wizard cannot. 

[spoiler]
Clairvoyance is a natural phenomenon that occurs within the magical community around the world. Some have said it’s an inherited skill, but it’s also been known to just randomly develop in a child of no clairvoyance lineage. One thing that people agree on though is that Clairvoyants are not made, they are born.

Clairvoyance is the ability to delve into the world of possibilities, maybes, and who knows. It’s fickle and ever changing. Because of it’s unusual flexibility (and margin for error) many witches and wizards scoff at the very idea that true clairvoyance exists. They deem it a guessing art with no real practicality. Those individuals are wrong.

Clairvoyants have commanded great respect and power throughout history. Those that can cope with the negatives and can learn from their visions are wise and knowledgeable and able to guide and advise others.

[div style="text-align:center;"][b]ABILITIES AND SKILLS[/b][/div]Clairvoyants have the capacity to know what is to come, but it can be far more complicated. It’s an ‘Inner Eye’, an over developed magical sense that most magical beings do not possess.

Clairvoyants are naturals in the art of Divination. Tea reading, crystal balls, etc. They have a much higher chance of success when using these materials to try and foresee the future.

[div style="text-align:center;"][b]STUDENTS:[/b][/div]Adolescent clairvoyants are more prone to being unable to control their power due to still being in their developmental years. While some may show an extraordinary amount of control for their age they are more susceptible to struggle.

Each Clairvoyant is unique in how their power manifests, so listed below are all the currently established forms of Clairvoyance used on the site, and we leave it open to the writer to decide which abilities they use.

(If you would like to use clairvoyance in a different way then the established abilities below please reach out to the Staff Lore team so we can ensure that it works in our universe.)

[li]Flashes - seconds long visions of the immediate future (the next few minutes to a few hours).[/li]

[li]Doom sense - a sense of how in danger people around you are.[/li]

[ul type="circle"][li]Prophecies - visions of world changing events with no time restriction (could be decades or centuries from now.)[/li]
[/ul][b][div style="text-align:center;"][b]TRIGGERS[/b][/div][/b]The Inner Eye is a very sensitive magical sense. So sensitive that it is able to pick up on the powers of the universe and see the future, a task that even the most accomplished of witches and wizards have failed to duplicate. Understandably many clairvoyants struggle to control their powers. Each person is unique in what may or may not cause them to lose control, but everyone has something (referred to as a ‘Trigger’). Sometimes it can be the most mundane of things. Simple daily tasks, certain emotions, even the company of particular individuals. Clairvoyants can learn to overcomer their triggers with practice and time (meditation is a great way to learn control.). It takes years of studying and commitment.

[div align="center"]cannot be combined with part giants
cannot be students[/div]

Legilimency is the act of magically navigating through a person's mind and interpreting their findings within. This is a learned trait and a character must be graduated (unless you have staff approval).

[spoiler]
Non-magical beings often mistake the art of Legilimency as simple ‘Mind Reading’. While that may be the closest description they have to it, they are still quite far from the truth. Legilimency is a difficult to master and complicated magical art that involves delving into another’s mind and being able to navigate and interpret one’s findings. It can be surface thoughts, deeper thoughts, memories, desires, etc. Those who practice (and master) this art can be both respected and distrusted by the community. Many see it as an invasion of privacy and rude to use on someone without their consent.

Legilimency is limited to your own understanding and knowledge. So if you don’t understand a language and that is what they are thinking in you will still ‘hear’ them but you won’t understand them. Accents can also prove difficult if you aren’t familiar with them.

Legilimency does NOT work on those trained in the art of Occlumency the way it should, as Occlumency and Legilimency are yin and yang to each other. (please read the section on Occlumency to see what occlumens are capable of doing when a legillimens attempts to read them.).

Here at Alohomora you do need to give people a heads up/get permission from the other writer when using Legilimens on their characters.


[div align="center"][b]ABILITIES AND SKILLS[/b][/div]Since Legilimency is a learned ability people can have varying levels of control even when they are the same age or studied for the same amount of time. Members can choose their own experience for this magical branch unless there is some sort of noted restriction. So consider realistically where your character would be and go with that. Characters that have only been studying it a few years are obviously still learning and wouldn’t be able to do the more difficult abilities.

[b]STUDENTS:[/b]
Legilimency is not taught at Hogwarts so it can be difficult for them to learn when they aren’t in the right circumstances. As such, students are NOT permitted to study Legilimency unless you have staff approval.

Listed below are all the currently established forms of Legilimency used on the site, and we leave it open to the writer to decide which abilities they use.

(If you would like to use legilimency in a different way then the established abilities please reach out to the Staff Lore team so we can ensure that it works in our universe.)

[ul type="circle"]
[li]Legilimens spell - The spell. Lets you read the other person’s memories and thoughts. Channeled - if your concentration breaks the spell ends. People feel your intrusion.[/li]
[li]Lie detection - You will have an easier time recognizing when people are lying to you. (unless the person is an accomplished liar or other means prevent you from reading them.)[/li]
[li]Personal reading - You know when people nearby are thinking about you and have a general understanding of what they are thinking. (example: Someone is thinking this about you: “So-and-so is handsome because of their blue eyes and dark hair.”. You would know they think you are attractive, but not what they are thinking specifically.)[/li]
[li]Non-verbal Legilimens - Non verbal version of the spell. As long as you maintain eye contact it won’t be broken. People still feel your intrusion.[/li]
[li]Bond legilimens - Reading the surface thoughts for fleeting moments of those you have a close bond with (family, close friends, partners, etc.).[/li]
[li]Strong emotion legilimens - Strong emotions will grant you access to a person’s surface thoughts. You will have access to the information about the emotion and why they are feeling it. (example. They are upset because it’s the anniversary of a parent’s death and they can’t go visit the gravesite. You would feel they are sad, that their parent was dead, how close they were to said parent, that today is the anniversary of the death, and they can’t visit the grave site.).[/li]
[/ul]
[b]RESTRICTED ABILITIES[/b]
These are abilities that exist but aren’t permitted to be used without staff approval.
[ul type="circle"]
[li]Memory manipulation - Manipulate and plant memories and thoughts into another person’s mind. Magical bonds (example: Harry Potter was a horcux of Voldemort and thus bound to him.) between individuals make it much easier. People are unaware that these are manipulated thoughts and memories.[/li]
[li]Enhanced Imperius Curse - Those who have mastered Legilimency are dangerous when using the Imperius curse. Even the strongest of willed people will bend to their command.[/li]
[li]Enhanced Non-verbal Legilimens - the fully manifested power of the spell. Imagine Quennie from Fantastic Beasts. These individuals no longer require the ‘spell’, and can catch the surface thoughts of everyone around them. This form of legilimens will only catch surface thoughts. (example: they can not see a person's memories when using this skill.)[/li]

[div align="center"]cannot be combined with part giants
cannot be students[/div]

Occlumency prevents individuals possessing legilimency to access their thoughts or feelings and influencing how they act. This is a learned trait and a character must be graduated (unless you have staff approval).

[spoiler]
Occlumency is the defense of the mind. It is closing off your thoughts, feelings, memories, etc from unwanted intrusion of any kind. It revolves around control and steadiness of ones emotions, emptying your thoughts, and overall self control. The mental strength of occlumens is nothing to mock.

While it’s often seen as just magical defense, masters of occlumency are overall formidal when it comes to their mental defenses. This makes them naturals at resisting interrogation, makes them master deceivers, and impervious to all mental intrusion magic (unless stated otherwise.)

Occlumency is the opposite to Legilimency. They are yin and yang. Thus, it makes occlumency quite interesting when someone is attempting to penetrate their mind. (refer to the abilities below to see how.)

[div align="center"][b]ABILITIES AND SKILLS[/b][/div]Since Occlumency is a learned ability people can have varying levels of control even when they are the same age or studied for the same amount of time. Members can choose their own experience for this magical branch unless there is some sort of noted restriction. So consider realistically where your character would be and go with that.

(If you would like to use Occlumency in a different way then the established abilities please reach out to the Staff Lore team so we can ensure that it works in our universe.)
[ul type="circle"]
[li]Natural Mental Defense - Your mind can not be penetrated by the Legilimency spell or other mental intrusion magic unless you desire.[/li]
[li]Deception - Even the most skilled lie detectors can not catch a hint of deception from you.[/li]
[li]Lie Detection - Likewise, because they are naturally so good at deception it is very difficult to deceive them (other Legilimens can though.)[/li]
[li]Possession Resistance - Natural resistance to any sort of possession (even the Imperius curse).[/li]
[li]Detection - They are always aware of someone (and will know who specifically) trying to penetrate their mind, even by the most skilled of Legilimens. They can let a Legiilmens into their mind if they want.[/li]
[li]Mental Deception - If they let a legilimens into their mind the legilimens will only pick up what the occlumen wants them to, nothing more. The legilimens will be unaware that these are fake thoughts.[/li]
[li]Emotion Suppression - Occlumency depends on emotional control. So, likewise they are able to suppress their own emotions and ‘turn them off’ when needed.[/li]
