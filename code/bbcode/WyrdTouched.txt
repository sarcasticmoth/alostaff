Twisting people however it desires. It's near impossible to tell how the Wyrdness might change one, as you are entirely at the Wyrdness' mercy. Those who have been blessed or cursed by the Wyrdness are called "Wryd Touched". These changes can be physical, mental, or both. It's highly unpredictable. Some changes may be very minor, while others catastrophic. It's almost like playing Russian roulette. 

NOW, there are requirements to buy these shop items, besides just having the galleons. The character in question MUST have a thread (current, completed, whatever) on the Wyrdness to claim these items. You can buy them ahead of time but they won't be 'activated' until you actually have been in contact with the wyrdness. AKA, you have to actually visit the Wyrdness to become Wyrd Touched. We also will not be limiting Wyrd Touches per members/characters at this time (so you can theoretically have multiple on a single character), but you will have to visit the island each time. (aka, only one Wyrd Touched per visit).

Staff will PM you the description of the wyrd touch as well as add it on this specific list.

@astrid           
-- As long as you are on Yrisle you have the physical appearance of a wyrdling. You cannot use a wand when transformed into a wyrdling.&nbsp;

@aymeric                 
--&nbsp;Have fish gills and are thus be able to breathe under water. 

@bianca                                
--&nbsp;All food becomes tasteless (meat, vegetables, fruit). Everything tastes like ash pretty much. 

@claire                               
--&nbsp;Lose all sense of direction (you know where everything is but you kinda always have to do a double take because you go wrong the first time)

@colton                  
-- Your body acts somewhat like a Kevlar vest. When hit hard, it solidifies for a second before turning into jelly for several minutes or until hit again.

@dahlia                           
--&nbsp;Once the character has fallen asleep they cannot wake up naturally (someone/something has to wake them up)

@crimson1           
-- The more you care about somebody, the harder they become for you to see. The people you care about most are invisible to you.&nbsp;

@eeva                                  
-- You can hear the thoughts of all creatures (wyrd touched or not) in your surroundings as if they were speaking to you in a normal tone of voice (in terms of volume) this includes all insects and small creatures so you can hear them scream in horror as people step on them.
--&nbsp;You remember everything that Hannah Webb (your doppelg√§nger) ever experienced or remembered, including her death, as if you lived both her life and your own. 

@lockhart           
-- Everybody that looks at you gets an irresistible urge to laugh, chuckle, snort or otherwise show their amusement.&nbsp;

@ilija                        
-- When in a situation of high emotion/intensity time moves 3x slower and your emotions/sensations at 3x stronger. He moves at a normal speed in his own mind (to the rest of the world he appears to move 3x faster though).

@jim           
-- You are a very strong magnet. You attract metal objects from a distance of 5 ft away from you and your magnetic field interferes with muggle technology of any kind.&nbsp;

@kalju                            
--&nbsp;You get to see an infographic of every creature you see. The fun little infographic mostly shows how these creatures can kill you and how many other living things they've killed in their life span, even if it was just for sustaining themselves for food.

@levi                    
-- Whenever you come within 200ft of somebody under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol you will feel the effects of whatever they took in the same scale as they do. So if somebody gets drunk of three beers, you feel drunk too.&nbsp;

@luthien                         
--&nbsp;See everything in black and white EXCEPT the colour yellow
-- You now have a tail. You can decide the appearance of this tail yourself. PM staff once you have the appearance of you tail for sake of adding it to the claims.
-- When the weather is hot, you feel like your freezing and when the weather is cold you feel like your boiling but your still susceptible to the current weather even if you can't feel what it is and must dress accordingly.
-- When you hurt someone, you feel a fraction of the pain (1/10th) yourself. (basically when hurting others you will always share a portion of their pain).

@parvati            
--&nbsp;If you stop moving your body starts to slowly turn to stone, you must always move at least a little bit to keep from becoming a statue.

@phil           
-- Everybody you touch gets a physical affliction. It can be as small as a triggered funny bone or a sneeze/cold or a serious injury or sickness.&nbsp;

@priscilla                              
-- All plants you touch die.

@raleigh                 
--&nbsp;You only see in monochrome now, but with different shades of pink rather than grey.

@rosie             
--&nbsp;Your hair grows ridiculously fast and Never Stops Growing. If you don't cut it every single day your hair will be longer than that of Rapunzel within a fourth night. Additionally you have a piece of Wyrdness inside your soul. While this wyrd touch is active your vampirism is completely inactive. The moment this wyrd touch ends the vampirism reactivates.&nbsp;

@sarah                             
--&nbsp;For every single person you maim, kill or otherwise harm you body changes. You slowly morph into what other people would see you as, a monster. It can be a patch of scales, it can be longer finger nails, it can be pointy teeth. For all harm you do from this point forward you will acquire a monstrous marking.

@shreya                         
-- animal curse. You turn into a horse when you smell grass/hay. You turn back when you are far enough away not to smell it anymore.

@xantha                         
--&nbsp;Smell thoughts self (you smell differently to people depending on your emotion)
