[table style="color:rgb(85, 85, 85);"][tbody][tr][td][div style="text-align:justify;padding:10px;"]JK Rowling has supplied us with a plethora of surnames that exist in the magical world but we don't know much about.

These families are entirely up for grabs for characters. So, a few ground rules about them, to start:

[ul type="circle"][li]The first person to claim a surname is the 'creator' and gets to decide the basic family makeup. Parents, blood status (They do have to be half or pureblood. These are magical families so they can't be muggleborn.), siblings, history, etc.&nbsp;[/li]
[li]No direct descendants of characters we know died. You can make relatives of them though.[/li][/ul]

Please note: Purebloods are not common, and most wizards now a days are half bloods. So if you want a pureblood you have to take one of these names.  There are a few exceptions listed in the rules though!

[div style="text-align:center;"][/div][b]TO CLAIM:[/b]

[code]name - let me know if you want strikethrough to close off name to be solely controlled by you or asterisk to leave open to other descendants made by other members[/code]
[div style="text-align:center;"]* - family is used but open to more descendants.[/div]

The ‘Sacred Twenty-Eight’ would be embraced by Voldemort, despite being a half-blood himself, and sneered at by wizards who recognized that the wizarding world would have died out if their ancestors hadn’t married Muggles.[/span][/div][div style="text-align:justify;"]

[/div][div style="text-align:justify;"][span style="text-align:justify;"][b]Gaunt [/b]– Quite where Voldemort got his meanness from is indicated from the portrait Rowling paints of his grandfather, Marvolo Gaunt, and his uncle Morfin. Obsessed with their own pure-blood status and with being the only living descendants of Salazar Slytherin, they terrorise Voldemort’s mother Merope, and accuse her of being a Squib. After a string of attacks on Muggles, the two Gaunt men end up in Azkaban, leaving Merope alone to enchant a local Muggle boy Tom Riddle – and we all know that didn’t end well.[/span][/div][div style="text-align:justify;"][span style="text-align:justify;"][b][font color="#a64253"]This family is extinct.[/font][/b][/span][/div][div style="text-align:justify;"]
