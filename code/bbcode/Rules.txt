If we have less then five names for a country you can make original pureblood families from that country if: they are from that region (ie they can't have moved there) and they spent at least the first 18 years of life there (ie they were raised there.).

[/li][li]We have an optional rule section below that includes nonwizards that can be made!

[ul type="circle"][li]Characters that have not posted in 60 days will be marked inactive. If an additional 14 days pass, the account will be deleted. Staff will message you requirements to be reactivated.[/li][li]We have a 3 strike rule for inactivity. This is per character, and is for a 12 month period. 1st time - no penalty, just get active. 2nd time - staff will make you take some action with the character. (this CAN, but isn't limited to, making you do a character redo or redoing your app/sorting process.) 3rd time - The character will be deleted.[/li][li]Journal entries, communications (owls, instant messengers, etc), one shots, and threading with yourself do not count towards activity.[/li][li]Threads with no activity in 3 months are considered dead, and will be moved to the archive.

[/li][li]Staff will not be resurrecting archived threads (returning them from the archives) unless there were exceptional circumstances around it going dead (study abroads, someone had a major RL situation that caused a major slow in activity, etc). If it's older then 6 months though it won't be resurrected whatsoever.
[/li][li]If we see consistent activity rule skirting, we may rule differently on a case-by-case basis (this means if you are repeatedly barely doing enough to be considered active).

[ul type="circle"][li]We permit more than just wizardkind. Some of these types are free and others will have to be purchased in the Galleon shop located HERE.[/li][li]Muggle/No-maj: FREE. To make a muggle they need to have some sort of connection to the wizarding world (such as a close relative, a lover, etc.). Muggles can't interact with several things in the wizarding world (ex: they can't see dementors), and anti-muggle charms make it impossible for them to go to Hogwarts and Dragon reserves.[/li][li]Squibs: Galleon Purchase. Squibs are nonmagical offspring of magical parents. They can't perform any magic, but unlike muggles they can interact with the wizarding world without any hindrance.[/li][li]Second Salemers/Witch Hunters: Galleon Purchase. They are descendents of "Scourers" (Renegade American wizards that went into hiding). They are basically multi-generational squibs. No magic themselves, but they can interact with the wizarding world. Please refer to Magical American Culture for more info on them.

[/li][li]Vampires: FREE. You can learn about Vampires HERE. Vampires have been included here to clarify that muggle vampires are a thing and 100% allowed (they just can't use magic)! Half vampires/half muggles are also permitted if their vampire parent was muggle prior to turning and their other parent is muggle as well.
[/li][li]Veelas: FREE. You can learn about Veelas HERE. Veelas have been included here to clarify that part veela/part muggle are a thing and 100% allowed (they just can't use wizardry magic).
