These are claims that you can use, but we don't require them. We won't list them here, but go check them out. These are claims that staff runs (such as the special abilities and affiliations) that your characters aren't required to use and claims that members themselves want and run themselves.

Since we do IC publications, you can have specific publication restrictions for characters.  Please note,  having characters with restrictions may affect what can be said about other characters depending on what kind of restrictions you set. Staff will refer to publication approvals/restrictions before publishing anything to ensure it falls within what's allowed.

Use this guide to fill out the Publication Restrictions section:

1. No Publication Restrictions: your character that can be featured without restrictions. Anything can be published about them.
2. Publication Restrictions: characters that have some form of restriction. explain what it is.
3. No Publication Allowed: nothing can be published about these characters whatsoever even if news is submitted about them.
