Twisting people however it desires. It's near impossible to tell how the Wyrdness might change one, as you are entirely at the Wyrdness' mercy. Those who have been blessed or cursed by the Wyrdness are called "Wryd Touched". These changes can be physical, mental, or both. It's highly unpredictable. Some changes may be very minor, while others catastrophic. It's almost like playing Russian roulette. 

NOW, there are requirements to buy these shop items, besides just having the galleons. The character in question MUST have a thread (current, completed, whatever) on the Wyrdness to claim these items. You can buy them ahead of time but they won't be 'activated' until you actually have been in contact with the wyrdness. AKA, you have to actually visit the Wyrdness to become Wyrd Touched. We also will not be limiting Wyrd Touches per members/characters at this time (so you can theoretically have multiple on a single character), but you will have to visit the island each time. (aka, only one Wyrd Touched per visit).

Staff will PM you the description of the wyrd touch as well as add it on this specific list.

@astrid                      
-- As long as you are on Yrisle you have the physical appearance of a wyrdling. You cannot use a wand when transformed into a wyrdling.&nbsp;

@bianca                                           
--&nbsp;All food becomes tasteless (meat, vegetables, fruit). Everything tastes like ash pretty much. 

@claire                                          
--&nbsp;Lose all sense of direction (you know where everything is but you kinda always have to do a double take because you go wrong the first time)

@colton                             
-- Your body acts somewhat like a Kevlar vest. When hit hard, it solidifies for a second before turning into jelly for several minutes or until hit again.

@dahlia                                      
--&nbsp;Once the character has fallen asleep they cannot wake up naturally (someone/something has to wake them up)

@lockhart                      
-- Everybody that looks at you gets an irresistible urge to laugh, chuckle, snort or otherwise show their amusement.&nbsp;

@ilija                                   
-- When in a situation of high emotion/intensity time moves 3x slower and your emotions/sensations at 3x stronger. He moves at a normal speed in his own mind (to the rest of the world he appears to move 3x faster though).

@parvati                       
--&nbsp;If you stop moving your body starts to slowly turn to stone, you must always move at least a little bit to keep from becoming a statue.

@sarah                                        
--&nbsp;For every single person you maim, kill or otherwise harm you body changes. You slowly morph into what other people would see you as, a monster. It can be a patch of scales, it can be longer finger nails, it can be pointy teeth. For all harm you do from this point forward you will acquire a monstrous marking.
