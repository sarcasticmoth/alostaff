[div style="text-align:center;"]
[/div]Part giants are tanks, with heightened strength and resistance to magic, but also have a difficult time learning how to use magic.

On Alohomora part Giants can be half, quarter, and eighth.

[spoiler]
[div style="text-align:center;"]GENERAL APPEARANCE[/div]Half giants are known for their unusual size and height. They naturally will be quite a bit taller, and larger, then their pure human counterparts. They are typically between the height of 7-9 feet in height, a rare few exceeding that height on occasion. (We are going off of the movies' depiction of half giants. Hagrid in the movies was under 9 feet in height.) Even when their giant blood is diluted past 1/8th, they can still maintain heights above 6 feet.

They are large in nature and almost always above average weight. Much of their mass is muscle.

While not always, they can inherit black eyes from their giant parent, grandparent, etc.


[div style="text-align:center;"]AGING AND PHYSICAL ABILITIES[/div]Part-giants age at the same rate as witches and wizards, which means a natural lifespan of at least 150 years due to their magical nature. Part-giants do not lose muscle definition as they grow older, however, and this combined with their natural resistance to sickness means they will often be in superb health and physical condition compared to a wizard of the same age.

Part-giants have above average physical strength, and resilience. They can typically lift 3-4 times that of an average human (this is depicted as more in the books and movies but this has been watered down for our use). And simply do to their size it can be harder to inflict enough damage to bring one down. They do have surprisingly quick reflexes (their giant relatives being known to catch birds from the sky.).

Part-giants can survive entirely on meat from their giant heritage, but through their human heritage they can also eat fruits and vegetables. However, all part-giants down to one-eighth must have meat in their diet. Beyond one-eighth, part-giants are physically human.

Part-giants naturally recover quicker from injuries. They can regrow their teeth, should one be damaged in some way. Their healing ability is equivalent to twice that of a pure human (it will only take them 3-4 weeks to heal a broken bone while a pure human would take 6-8 weeks.)


[div style="text-align:center;"]WEAKNESSES[/div]The magical resilience of part-giants cuts both ways. Part-giants will naturally fight off the few curses that affect them over a period of time, and their bodies have a tendency to recover at a faster natural rate than humans. But they also cannot use magical means to recover themselves. Healing spells and potions do not have any affect on them unless extremely potent.

They also will have a natural disadvantage to learning magic. Since they are so naturally resistant to magic it will take them twice as long, if not more time, to learn new spells. The most complicated of spells can even be completely out of their ability to use entirely. Nor will they be able to use transfiguration magic on themselves to any degree (even to change their eyebrow color).

Part-giants are known to still have their giant relatives temper. Naturally they have a violent temper, though they can learn how to control this. Due to their incredible strength as well, they are typically unable to do tasks that require delicate work.


[div style="text-align:center;"]SOCIETAL STATUS[/div]Part-giants are a rare occurrence so it can, at times, be difficult for people to recognize one. So they can, at times, be known to fly under the radar. When they are recognized for what they are they are treated much like other demihumans. Which is; it depends on who they talk to. Some people will immediately accept someone for not being full human without a fuss while others will find them unnnatural and dangerous. Many people can, and will, try to stir up problems for part-giants because they believe that part-giants are just as wild as their giant relatives and don't deserve a place in the Wizarding society.

Because of their physical capabilities they have been banned from competing in all magical sports (like Quidditch) at a professional level. They can also have some difficulty getting into the Aurors program because they have immense difficulty passing some of the tests.

Part goblins are magical hot springs, with endless potential. On the other hand, they are quite frail and social outcasts to both goblins and humans.[/span]
[/div]
On Alohomora part Goblins are only 'part' because of their unusual bloodlines.

[spoiler]
Part Goblins are curious beings. Goblin blood acts quite differently than all other demi humans. While other demi humans get weaker the less percentage they are, part goblins can retain their full capabilities for several generations. It is a recessive gene that will lie dormant (even up to six generations) before presenting itself, and when it does you will get a child who shares many key characteristics with their goblin ancestors. Because of this it is entirely possible for a couple (with one having a Goblin ancestor) to have a human child and a part goblin child. They are not classified as part goblin unless the gene is dominant in them.


[div style="text-align:center;"]GENERAL APPEARANCE[/div]Goblins are short in stature humanoids with very sharp, angular features, pointed ears, sharp teeth, solid black eyes, and long fingers. Only those who the gene presents strongly in will have recognizable goblin features. They will usually be shorter in nature (though not as short as their ancestor. Average height for a manifested part goblin is about five feet.), will have unusually dark eyes and sometimes solid black, sharper teeth then normal (but not quite as sharp as their ancestors.), pointed ears, and long fingers. They have a very elfish look to them.


[div style="text-align:center;"]AGING AND PHYSICAL ABILITIES[/div]Part goblins age quite peculiarly, in the sense that their sharp features can make them quite difficult to accurately age. Because of their naturally shorter stature they are not a physically intimidating folk and can be mistaken for being younger if they aren't into their elderhood (and wrinkling.). They are naturally frailer than the average human (which has lead to disfigurement in full and part goblins.). But, they have very good eye sight and hearing. Both these senses are heightened above that of an average human.

Because of how frail they are part goblins are unable to play contact sports (such as quidditch) professionally. They are simply too big a liability on the field because of how easily they can be permanently injured.


[div style="text-align:center;"]MAGICAL ABILITIES[/div]While Goblins have their own form of magic no part Goblin is taught any of it. Regardless, part Goblins do inherit a unusually high level of intelligence and a sharp wit. Almost always a part Goblin will be sorted into Ravenclaw due to this natural born brilliance. They particularly excel in magical items and enchantments (like their Goblin relatives).They are also magically hardy against heat and fire, not immune but they do not burn easily. What will leave third degree burns on most will only leave first degree burns on a part goblin. In all, part Goblins are extremely magically gifted in most ways. They excel and adapt to all forms of magic with surprising ease.


[div style="text-align:center;"]WEAKNESSES[/div]Obvious, their stature and physical capabilities are a negative. They are frailer, and their shorter legs make it harder to keep up with full sized companions. Like their ancestors, most part Goblins are greedy to some extent, which doesn't help their image of being untrustworthy. Since they are so receptive to magic as a whole though, this does make them a little... vulnerable to magic. Spells will affect them much faster than a normal person, and potentially be much more powerful against them.


[div style="text-align:center;"]SOCIETAL STATUS[/div]Goblins and humans have been at odds for hundreds of years, and this turmoil still continues to this day. Only instead of actual wars they battle over finances. The Goblins are seen as vital but subservient members of society, which has led to extreme discrimination against their part human offspring. The obvious part goblins are treated poorly, and often have to deal with people not understanding that the wand they carry is in fact their own (since Goblins are not permitted wands), and that they are in fact part human. At the same time, many full blooded goblins see part goblins as stains in their society and treated like outcasts (which is why part goblins are not trained in Goblin magic). In all, part Goblins are both outcasts to humans and Goblins.

[/div][/td][/tr][tr][td][div style="background-color:#ffffff;padding:10px;text-align:justify;"][div style="text-align:center;padding-bottom:3px;margin-bottom:-5px;font:18px Georgia;border-bottom:solid 1px #4A7482;"]VAMPIRE AND PART VAMPIRE[/div]
[div style="text-align:center;"]full vampires cannot be students[/div]

Vampires have an affinity for biting humans on their neck and sucking their blood.

On Alohomora part Vampires can be half, and quarter.

[spoiler]
[div style="text-align:center;"]GENERAL APPEARANCE[/div]Vampires are pale, their skin coming in the hues of white and grey that you see in stormclouds. They have red eyes and prominent fangs where normal humans have canines. Vampires aren't able to tan because the have no sunlight resistance. Vampires are thin and gaunt, and are incapable of gaining significant amounts of weight.

Vampires will retain the same look (the look from when they were turned.) for most of their lives. In their final few years, they will take on a more monstrous appearance and become even skinnier, with longer fangs, fingers, and limbs.

Despite their underfed appearance, vampires generally have attractive faces, the better to lure prey with.


[div style="text-align:center;"]AGING AND PHYSICAL ABILITIES[/div]Vampires are not undead, despite their classification as Living Dead. They age more slowly than humans—the oldest known vampire lived past 300 years of age—but they do age and die naturally. They are also capable of breeding with humans. A typical vampire’s lifespan is 200-250 years old.

Vampires can ingest and process foods other than blood, particularly things with high sugar contents, such as pastries: blood-flavored lollipops have stayed in business for a reason. However, vampires must regularly feed on human blood, or they will starve to death. Typically a vampire’s bite will do no lasting harm to a human; it takes several consecutive feedings to turn a human into a vampire. However, a vampire can kill a human by draining too much blood from them. Muggles tend to be a vampire’s preferred prey; a trained witch or wizard is much harder to dupe. Witches and wizards can also volunteer their blood, and spouses may do so regularly, as a Blood-Replenishing Potion can immediately counteract the blood loss. Vampire saliva heals their bite marks, leaving no trace of their presence.

Vampires can sense the quality of blood in their targets. So they will know if someone is anemic, for example.

Vampires are resistant to most forms of disease and sickness, and cannot be turned into werewolves. Werewolves normally will not attack vampires, as they are not a suitable target. Vampires can also take physical damage better than most humans, but they have no additional magical resistance.

Vampires do not have superhuman strength and speed; they typically have the same physical abilities as a moderately-trained human athlete. However, their bodies resist the buildup of fatigue toxins, so they almost never tire.

Vampires are nocturnal by nature. They see well in the dark, but their vision suffers when it’s bright.

Vampires are extremely quiet and stealthy individuals. A vampire is considered clumsy if they cannot sneak up on a distracted or dozing human, drink from them, and slip away without being noticed at any point.


[div style="text-align:center;"]MAGICAL ABILITIES[/div]Vampires are capable of using wands and magic if they were a witch or wizard before being turned. Muggles turned into Vampires can not.

Vampires, despite being capable of good or evil, are considered dark creatures in the wizarding world. They are studied in Defense Against the Dark Arts and are incapable of casting certain spells, such as to Patronus Charm, due to their natures. Dementors, Lethifolds, and certain other Dark creatures will not attack vampires unprovoked.

Vampires have naturally alluring voices. Because of this, vampires have a natural talent for singing. Muggles and young/inexperienced wizardkind can become temporarily entranced by their singing, but wizardkind adults, and other magical beings/demi humans are unaffected.

Vampires have the ability to transform into a bat. They retain all their regular weaknesses when in batform, except a weakness to sunlight.

Vampires have the unusual ability to anchor their personal gravity to any surface, regardless of angle. This allows them to walk on walls and ceilings.


[div style="text-align:center;"]WEAKNESSES[/div]Vampires are weak to the sun, but they are not instantly turned to dust or burned to death by sunlight. Rather, their bodies have no natural defenses against sunlight. Sunlight makes them intensely uncomfortable, and long-term exposure to the sun will drain their body’s natural resistances. Their skin will begin to dissolve, and at that point, they have become extremely weak to diseases, poisons, and sickness, both magical and mundane, owing to their body’s exhaustion attempting to fight off the damage from the sunlight.

Vampires have severe aversions to both garlic and silver, being naturally allergic to both substances. A little bit won’t kill them, it can be lethal.

A patronus touching a vampire is like a third degree burn, and will cause extreme pain. Contact lasting more than a few seconds can kill a vampire.

A wooden stake through the heart is lethal for a vampire, but for the same reason that it would be lethal to a human.

Because of their sunlight weakness, vampires are unable to play outdoor sports (such as quidditch), because they are physically incapable of being out during the day long enough to even play.


[div style="text-align:center;"]SOCIETAL STATUS[/div]Vampires are not shunned in the same manner as werewolves. Despite being inherently Dark creatures, they have the same capacity for choice as humans, and because they can control their affliction (unlike werewolves), they are not regarded as fearfully by most of the magical community. A proper vampire can go their whole lives without causing any real harm to a single person. Because of this, there are international laws in place to protect vampires from being hunted and killed, and they are rarely discriminated against as harshly as the werewolves once were. Many famed singers are full or part vampire.

That being said, the murder of a human by a vampire is treated as harshly as it would be if a human had done it. Killing a human while feeding on them will often be punishable with death.


[div style="text-align:center;"]Creation of a Full Vampire[/div]One reason for vampires being somewhat more accepted is due to it being much more difficult to create a vampire than a werewolf. To create a new vampire, a full vampire must feed on the human in question three nights in a row. After the third feeding, the human must then drink the vampire’s blood to complete the transformation. While it is certainly possible for an evil vampire to forcibly turn someone by denying them food and drink, it is a much lengthier and more difficult process than a werewolf bite.

Vampires very rarely turn grown witches and wizards, instead preferring to turn Muggles. This is partly due to the fear of reprisal from other wizards, and partly due to the long-standing vampire pride in not needing wands, which a turned witch or wizard would be adept with and used to already. However, there are exceptions.

Vampires must notify their magical government beforehand if they wish to turn a Muggle into a vampire. An official government representative must be on hand to Obliviate the Muggle if they should refuse. Failure to notify the government is considered a breach of the Statute of Secrecy.

Vampires can only turn pure humans. Werewolves and humans with the blood of magical species, including part vampires, are immune to the curse of vampirism.


[div style="text-align:center;"]PART VAMPIRES[/div]Part vampires, or sometimes called Dhampyrs, are the offspring of vampires and humans. They keep the vampire parent’s pale, gaunt appearance, but also retain a vampire’s longer lifespan and resistance to physical injury.

While Dhampyrs are tougher than normal humans, they are not stronger or faster, and they also do not have the superhuman stamina of full vampires. A Dhampyr, physically speaking, is merely an athletic human.

Dhampyrs are capable of subsisting on human food and drink, needing only as much blood in a month as a true vampire would need in a night.

Dhampyrs can survive in sunlight just fine, though they sunburn very easily.

They are allergic to garlic, silver, and the Patronus charms, but exposure won't kill them unless in extreme amounts.

Dhampyrs lose most other vampire powers as well, including nocturnal vision, walking on walls, turning others into vampires, and turning themselves into bats. However, they retain the alluring voice of full vampires.

Individuals less than a quarter vampire may retain a pale complexion, but they are functionally human with none of a vampire’s powers or weaknesses and are not considered part vampires.

[div style="text-align:center;"]full Veelas cannot be students[/div]

Veelas are beautiful magical beings, with fiery tempers (and appearances), and natural enchanting skills that can seduce others.


[spoiler]
[div style="text-align:center;"]GENERAL APPEARANCE[/div]Veelas, both male and female, are known to be the most naturally beautiful magical beings in the world. They are built much like models, tall slender, and in good physical condition. European Veelas are commonly known to be blonde haired and blue eyed but they can have other hair and eye colors. 


[div style="text-align:center;"]AGING AND PHYSICAL ABILITIES[/div]Veelas age at the same rate as witches and wizards, but they maintain their youthful appearances much longer then their counterparts. They are naturally agile, graceful and have fast metabolisms that keep them in good physical condition without much work. They do not have any superior physical capabilities.


[div style="text-align:center;"]MAGICAL ABILITIES[/div]Veelas have three key abilities. Creating and manipulating fire, turning their heads into that of a bird-like head, and charming those physically attracted to them to the point of total and complete submission. People under a Veela's charm have been known to act in unusual ways to try to impress the Veela. This charm is strongest when Veelas are performing in some way, whether it's dancing, or singing.

The Veela charm only works on those who could be physically attracted to the individual (if you are not attracted to women a female Veela won't succeed in charming you. If the Veela is a child and you don't see them as mature enough it won't affect you.) 

Veelas are NOT wizards, and do not possess the ability to use wands, or cast spells. Their offspring do not attend magical schools, instead mostly being home schooled, going to small, specialized schools for Veela children, or non-magical schools.


[div style="text-align:center;"]WEAKNESSES[/div]They are known to be magically unstable because of their natural born charm. This can lead to many magical accidents while learning to perform new spells. Veela hair wands share the same unstable nature.

Full Veelas are not wizards. Likewise, they can't perform magic. This can limit them in their job options in the magical world. One example is Quidditch. Because they aren't wizards, they can't use brooms, so they are unable to play the sport. 


[div style="text-align:center;"]SOCIETAL STATUS[/div]While most demi-humans face some for of persecution and discrimination Veelas face very few challenges. Their natural beauty makes them incredibly desirably as romantic partners so they face fewer challenges. However they are still demi-human and can still be discriminated against for their status of not being fully human.

[div style="text-align:center;"]PART VEELAS[/div]Part Veelas are the offspring of full blooded Veelas and wizarding or muggle parents (Yes, Part Veelas can be part muggle, instead of part wizard!) Part Veelas inherit their Veela parent's physically natural good looks though it will slowly diminish over generations. Part Veelas can be both male and female, though males aren't as common.

Part Veelas do inherit the ability to charm those attracted to them, though it gets significantly weaker depending on how diluted their blood is. A half Veela is able to perform a powerful charm while an 1/8th is likely to only be able to charm their victim strong enough to peak their interest. Part Veela's do not inherit any other powers. Part Veelas (when their non-Veela side of the family is magical) can be more adept at fire and heat related spells then others. If their non-Veela side of the family is NOT magical, they do not inherit any kind of magic not related to Veelas.

Like all other demi-humans Part Veelas are unable to use transfiguration magic on themselves, including becoming animagi. Again, if their non-Veela side of the family is NOT magical, they cannot perform spells at all.

Often misunderstood, werewolves magically transform into wolves every full moon.

On Alohomora werewolves can only be turned, and the trait is not hereditary. Werewolves may also receive a mating Bond with another werewolf, which is a connection deeper than love. Not every werewolf has or discovers their Bond.  

[spoiler]
[div style="text-align:center;"]GENERAL APPEARANCE[/div]Werewolves do not look any different from a regular human during the majority of their lives. They maintain all of their human characteristics. When it is close to the full moon (a few days before to a few days after) they can look rather pale, frail, and sickly in general. This is easily mistaken for simple illness. Many of them, though not all, will have scars on their bodies from self inflicted injuries (when they were transformed.) Most werewolves will remain quite thin, and often struggle to maintain a healthy body weight. This is due to their monthly transformations always causing several days of illness.

During the fullmoon they will undergo a forced transformation into a large wolf. The color of their coat varies by the werewolf. While it can be difficult to spot there are a few characteristics that separate them from your normal wolf. They have shorter snouts and smaller paws and their tails are tufted.


[div style="text-align:center;"]AGING AND PHYSICAL ABILITIES[/div]Due to the harsh nature of forced transformations once a month Werewolves have been known to physically age faster then their counterparts. While their lifespans are the same they will likely gray and look more frail much faster.

They will transform on the night of the full moon (when the moon rises and the sun is fully set) each month. The days leading up to their transformation and several days after are usually very uncomfortable for werewolves, and can present itself with extreme restlessness and illness. The transformation itself is quite painful and once fully transformed they will forget their humanity unless they have taken the Wolfsbane potion that night. Once transformed they will be compelled to hunt humans (again, unless they took the potion). If they can not find a human they are likely to inflict harm on themselves. They are extremely aggressive to any humans they find, but practically harmless to animals and creatures that can not be turned into werewolves (including other demihumans). The company of those they will not attack can help sooth their desire to hurt themselves.

Muggles can not survive werewolf bites and will die. Wizards and witches though will instead become werewolves themselves if the injuries are healed with silver and dittany because only those will stop the bleeding. If this treatment is not sought the witch/wizard will bleed out and die. If you are harmed by a werewolf outside of the full moon you will not become one yourself but it will leave a permanent mark (no magic can fix) and at times cause wolf like characteristics.

Werewolves do not experience enhanced strength or speed when human. They have severe ADHD in their youth and can be quite restless. They will never do well in confining places, or being indoors for long periods.

Werewolves have a high preference for meat, even when human. They also prefer their meat on the very rare side. They are also naturally drawn to the night, but have no problems with sunlight.


[div style="text-align:center;"]MAGICAL ABILITIES[/div]They do not have any magical abilities given to them by becoming Werewolves.


[div style="text-align:center;"]WEAKNESSES[/div]Contrary to popular believe they do not have any problem with silver. Though mixture of powdered silver and dittany do seal wounds inflicted by Werewolves to prevent the victim from bleeding to death.

The transformation itself is extremely painful, as is the transformation back into a human. They will also experience several days of illness prior and after their transformations.


[div style="text-align:center;"]SOCIETAL STATUS[/div]Werewolves have often been met by extreme prejudice and distrust in the Wizarding world. In the past many attempts have been made to control, outlaw, and even exterminate Werewolves. It was extremely difficult in the past for Werewolves to find decent jobs even when they were full qualified for the position due to their condition.

The past twenty years has seen great improvement to the treatment of Werewolves in society. Laws have been made to prevent openly discriminating against these people, and programs have been created to help Werewolves come to terms with themselves and to also find others like them to form lasting and important friendships. There is still some discrimination and persecution though, especially from older Wizarding families.

A common misconception about Werewolves was also recently proven false, which has greatly improved Werewolves standing in society. It was previously believed that lycanthropy was genetic and could be passed down to their offspring. Recent studies have shown though that the offspring of Werewolves do not inherit any of the traits. With this myth now proven false many Werewolves have been able to have families with no fear of potentially passing on the ailment.

St. Mungos has also opened a clinic to assist Werewolves in obtaining the Wolfsbane potion prior to the full moon. With this program in place, many werewolves are now able to go through their monthly transformations in relative peace. Thus, Werewolf attacks are currently at the lowest they've ever been and the public's opinion of lycanthropy has greatly improved.

[/div]
Druids are witches and wizards that have deep roots to their Celtic ancestors. They are not a different "species", but instead simply practice a different way of life then modern wizardkind. Due to centuries of separation though, there are some very real difference between Druids and modern wizardkind. We will accept full blood and half blood druids for this claim. Anything less than half is too diluted to have the druid skills.

[spoiler]
[b][u]What Make Druids Special[/u][/b]
Druids are, upon first impression, just witches and wizards that do things differently. But, it's far deeper then that. If you make a Druid, these are things you will automatically have.
[ul type="circle"][li]Nature affinity - Druids like nature, yeah. But it's way more than that. Druids are naturally in tune with nature. They can feel a storm before it reaches their shores, they can feel an earthquake before it hits, they can smell the rain before the first drop falls from the sky. They just know and understand nature like a sixth sense.[/li][li]Animal affinity - Druids are basically a part of nature. So, they have developed a magical symbiotic relationship with all creatures. Creatures, magical and non-magical, do not see Druids at threats. In fact, they will immediately recognize a Druid as something good, and special. This can be as simple as a dog that isn't fond of people warming up to them immediately. But it can also be as deep as a Druid being able to step into a dragon den and the dragon not caring. The chance of a creature, ANY creature, not liking a Druid is virtually impossible.[/li][li]Magical Conduits - When you make a Druid you will automatically have three magical conduits (for free, yes). You will start with: A wand, a staff, and a wooden instrument of your choosing. These are the three most common magical conduits used by Druids. You can refer to the Magic section, under Culture, below for why those three.[/li][li]Animagi - Druids have one of the highest populations of animagi in the world. Because of their nature and animal affinity, they are naturally driven to become Animagus. Druids are exempt from the age restriction and member restriction for Animagi (Meaning you can have Druid animagus under 17, and you can have a Druid animagus even if you already have 2).[/li][/ul]
On the other end though, they do have some restrictions.

[div style="text-align:center;"][b][u]History[/u][/b][/div]Modern Druids are descendants of druids that escaped the Roman massacre around 60 AD. The Roman Empire had invaded Britannia, and was trying to force the Celtic people into submission. The Romans knew that as long as the Druids were around the Celts would never submit. Druids were religious and spiritual leaders. While many were human, some were, indeed, witches and wizards. 

When the Roman Empire attacked the Druids, most were killed and most their ritual/sacred sites destroyed. But, a brave few escaped and went into hiding. These few survivors, through decades of hard work, eventually created a sanctuary where the Romans would never find them. This sanctuary is an island known as Hy-Brasil. There are many legends about the island and it's often called the "phantom island". These stories come the few non-magical adventurers that spotted the island when the enchantments were still weak. Now-a-days, the island is completely iron tight, repelling all non-magical beings. 

The Druids have attempts to re-assimilate with other Wizardkind through out history, but all these attempts have failed. They fell prey to numerous, and extremely brutal, witch hunts. The druids, helpful by nature, were not prepared for how brutal humanity could be. Back in ancient times, they were respected members of society. But now? It was an incredibly cruel fate to realize the people you used to love had turned against you. The reaction of other wizard kind only solidified their mistrust of outsiders. Instead of trying to help them this "Ministry of Magic" told them to just go into hiding like they were. The Druids followed the advise, retreating to their island paradise. Thus their distrust of non-magical beings, and even other wizardkind, was solidified. 

There have been many conflicts between the Ministry of Magic and Druids over the centuries. By the 1800's, the Ministry and Druids finally entered into a truce. Druids were citizens of the Ministry. They would follow Ministry rules and laws. In return, the Ministry would let Druids govern themselves. In essence, a nation within a nation (There are several examples of this in modern society, if you want to better understand how this sort of relationship functions.). Druids also, somewhat reluctantly, started to permit other wizardkind to visit their own, though they still maintained the right to control their borders. Prior to the 1800's Druids had never permitted non-Druids to set foot on Hy-Brasil. Despite the treaty, Druids still butt heads often with the Ministry, depending on those in authority. For example, the Druids were actually very unhappy with Minister Kingsley as he pushed heavily against their laws and leaders. Kingsley's reign as Minister was widely considered one of inclusion by wizardkind... Unless you talk to a Druid. During Kingsley's time as Minister the Ministry passed a law requiring Druid children to participate in Ministry controlled OWL and NEWT exams. Many felt this was the Ministry's first step in trying to control their children and education. In addition the Ministry attempted to force the trace on Druid children (didn't pass, thankfully, but there were riots.), abolist the Druid's ban on non-magical beings/end the requirements of authorization to enter Hy-Brasil(also didn't pass.), permit Aurors to have authority to enforce the laws on Hy-Brasil (oh yeah, that one almost caused a full on revolt), and tried to regulate what magical creatures could and couldn't be kept on Hy-Brasil (yeah, that caused an uproar not just with Druids but also all magizoologists.). In general, while Kingsley was Minister the Ministry attempted to change a great many Druid laws under the guise of "unifying" the Druids with Ministry society. Unfortunately, this actually made the Druids close their borders to all visitors except a few trusted outsiders (mostly magizoologists that sided with them) from 2000 to 2005. The relationship between the Ministry and Druids has been very strained ever since.

Druids have become quite frustrated with the frequent Minister changes in the last few years. The constant leadership changes has made it difficult for Druids because they're constantly having to educate the new Minister on their customs and laws, and deal with any immediate attempts to change their laws. It's not necessarily the Minister themselves that attempt to pass these changes, but in fact the various departments that  re-attempt to get a change every time a new Minister is elected. (Without fail, the Department of Magical Education tries to pass the trace law every time a new Minister takes office...) 

[div style="text-align:center;"][b][u]Culture[/u][/b][/div][b][u]Hy-Brasil[/u][/b]
Their island sanctuary is more than just an island. Hy-Brasil is one of a kind. It's an island formed entirely out of magic. Magic is in the air, in the roots, in the very stones and water. If you took a magic sensing device, it would completely overload, unable to handle just how potent the magic is. It's so intense that non-magical life can't even exist (regular animals, plants, even non-magical beings.) on Hy-Brasil. The island itself is like walking into a fairy tale. There are no roads of any kind, instead all the paths are old but well kept cobblestone (though there aren't many paths in general! You'll only see them around homes or in town). The island is almost entirely forest, and there is only one "city" if you can even call it that. The city, known as Bouddica's Grace, acts as the "airport". There is a small port for any ships (this is also where all portkeys to the Island are bound. So when you come to visit, you'll land at the port.), a customs office (basically to ensure you are authorized to come to Hy-Brasil, and a few shops. That's it. No government buildings, nothing. The druids themselves build their homes in the forest. These homes are usually generation homes (several generations of the family living together.) Most of the houses are on their own as well, with only a few druid homes built near another. In essence, they are cottages in the woods, and you gotta really search to find them all if you don't know your way around Hy-Brasil. Druids have built their homes into the environment, so you have a variety on what their homes look like. Some will be like hobbit holes, burried into the earth, or built into huge trees, built in the trees, caves, etc.

Hy-Brasil has one of the most unique magical environments in existence. Because of how magically potent the place is, on top of the barrier that surrounds the island, it's actually entirely non-magic free. The island is absolutely teaming with magical life. You can't walk more then ten steps without spotting a fairy, a niffler, a kneazle, etc. It's even more dramatic then that though. There are a huge variety of even extremely dangerous magical creatures (even a few dragons). It's completely normal for you to find a dragon in your front yard in the morning! 

The plant life on Hy-Brasil is quite impressive. Because of how much magic radiates from the land remedies made from Hy-Brasil flora are some of the most powerful in the world. All the trees are of wand quality (so much so that Hy-Brasil has a bit of a bowtruckle infestation problem.). The Druids, in recent years, have been able to make quite a profit exporting their herbal remedies and wood around the world. 

[b][u]Language[/u][/b]
Inhabitants of Hy-Brasil speak their own unique language, known as "Brasilic", which is rooted in common Brittonic, an ancient celtic language that many modern celtic languages come from. It resembles modern Welsh and Gaelic (as they share the same roots), but it's developed into a completely independent language over the past 2000 years. They all speak English as well, but you'll rarely hear them speak in English on Hy-Brasil unless a Non-Druid is part of the conversation.

Druids commonly know the languages of other magical beings as well, far more often then other wizards. So don't be surprised if a Druid can speak mermish, or goblin.

[b][u]The People[/u][/b]
Their ancestors have faced extreme hardships. As such, the people of Hy-Brasil are an extremely proud, and resilient people. They do not waver when facing an obstacle. On the other hand though, they do not like change. They are wary of strangers and don't trust non-druids easily. They are very anti-muggle though, and will never welcome a non-magical person into their society.

The Druids hold fast to ancient traditions, and beliefs. They live in total harmony with all life on Hy-Brasil. They have many festivals and feasts to welcome the changing seasons, to celebrate births, marriages, etc. The Druids in general never hesitate to have a feast. They love to gather together and celebrate. 


[b][u]Religion[/u][/b]
Druids are very religious/spiritual. They are raised in the old faith, in which they believe everything has a spirit. They also believe that death is simply a new journey. It's a time of mourning, but also great rejoicing as you move on to Otherworld (the home of deities and the dead). They also believe that their ancestors can still communicate with them through nature and creatures. As such, they worship the world around them. All of their holidays and festivals are known of their countless offerings to their ancestors and the world they are blessed to live in. 

Druids believe in dark gods (or evil spirits). In fact, they greatly fear them, and can be very superstitious. The dark gods are beings of darkness that seek nothing else but destruction. They may refer to negative emotions (such as greed), evil acts (such as murder) as the influence of dark gods. They also believe that the dark arts are the magic of dark gods. As such, Druids have extreme issues when it comes to anything dark arts related. Even dark creatures/beings like Acromantulas (though a few live on their island...), dementors, vampires, etc (Just refer to HERE for tons of magical beings/creatures that are considered dark.) The greatest taboo in their religion is a druid practicing the dark arts. They will banish Druids that do this. Likewise, they have serious issues with non-Druids that cast dark art spells, even just a simple hex. In their religion, the dark arts will corrupt you and bend you to the will of the dark gods.  Druids believe that those corrupted by the dark gods will be eaten by their deities once they reach Otherworld (Basically, when they die, they think the gods will eat you, so your soul won't live in Otherworld).

[b][u]Genetics[/u][/b]
Originally descended from the Celts, the Druids are a genetically and geographically isolated people. While a few outsiders have been welcomed into the Druid community over the millennia, the rates of genetic and phenotypic variation are far lower than those found in other magical and non-magical communities.

Druids resemble their closest relatives (British/Irish/Scotts/Welsh). They are typically pale, with light colored eyes, and have an outrageously high red head population. So high in fact that there are easily more red haired Druids than any other hair color. 

In recent years however, there have been converts to the Druid way of life. This has introduced new ethnic diversity to the people, though they are still a minority on Hy-Brasil. This diversity is more common among Druids and their descendants that don't live on Hy-Brasil full time.

Generally speaking, you can be of druid descent but not a practicer of their religion or lifestyle. But, it's been shown that Druid-blood thins out very quickly. Offspring of druids can lose their druid skills (animal and nature affinity) if they are 25% or less druid (so they only retain it if one parent is a druid. They lose it if the grandparent is the full blood druid).

[b][u]Festivals/Rituals[/u][/b]
The Druids love their festivities. They have many holidays. These holidays are all very similar. Dancing, feasting, offerings to nature and their ancestors, etc. To an outsider the festivals may even come across as identical to each other. The have many official festivals, but they will also celebrate any sort of life change. Births, turning 17, marriages, even deaths. 

The main festivals the Druids celebrate are: Imbolc (February 2) – Beginning of Spring, Ostara (March 19-22) - Spring Equinox, Beltane (May 1) – Beginning of summer, Litha (June 19-23) – Summer solstice, Lughnasadh (August 1) – Beginning of fall/harvest, Mabon (September 21-24) – Fall Equinox, Samhain (November 1) – Beginning of winter, and Yule (December 20-23) – Winder Solstice

There is one additional holiday, though it’s more of a time of mourning. January is simply known as “The time of Passing”. During this month the Druid people take time to ponder on the trials of their ancestors, mourn their loses, and give thanks for their courage. It is a somber month, in which they do not hold any other celebrations (you can’t even get married in Hy-Brasil in January). This time of mourning is broken on Imbolc. Any events that happen in January that would warrant a celebration (like a birth, coming of age, etc), is held off until February. Many consider January an unlucky month to be born.

February, understandably, is one of their biggest celebration months. While they only have one festival (Imbolc), because they delay all potential festivities from January, the month in general can be jam packed with numerous feasts. Lets just say if you ever want to party hard, visit Hy-Brasil in February because something will literally be going on every single night.

Druids also perform special rituals for things. Such as a birth, they will make an offering to the gods to bless the baby. Same for coming of age (17), death, etc. Druids do perform animal sacrifices during these rituals (much to the Ministry's displeasure).

[b][u]Magic[/u][/b]
The Druid people are, of course, witches and wizards. They can perform all normal magic. They just prefer to practice magic differently. For Druids, they respect and worship magic just like nature. It's as much a part of them as nature is. Because of this, they believe that modern witches and wizards are lazy, and forget how truly beautiful and wonderful magic can be. Druids do use wands, but that's not necessarily their main tool. They use a wide variety of magical conduits. It depends entirely on their purpose. You will almost never see a Druid using a wand when doing potion work. For healing they prefer to use natural remedies found on the island, only resorting to actual magic if it's life threatening. Nature and elemental magic is strongest with a staff, in their opinion. Wandless magic is also very common. In general, you may see wands, but Druids don't limit themselves.

[b][u]Education[/u][/b]
Druids do not attend Hogwarts. Instead, they teach their children in a more "informal" setting. They do have designated teachers, and meet in small groups of similar aged kids, but their schooling is out in the woods, surrounded by nature. They learn magic by experience. They read the stars. They learn the names of creatures, etc. They do NOT teach their children anything non-magical ("what's a computer?")  unless it's a necessity ("That giant thing in the sky is called a Plane."). Most of their non-magical education comes from visitors and their families/friends that spent time off Hy-Brasil.

Druid children aren't behind their Hogwarts educated peers, however. In fact, some say they are well ahead. They begin magical education at the age of five on the island. Druid children do not have the trace, and are free to perform magic before becoming adults. So while their UK peers are learning to read and write, Druid children are already learning their first formal spells. 

Druids, understandably, all share a common advanced knowledge of herbology, magical creatures, and herbal remedies. They are surrounded by these three topics from birth, so they are learning all about these topics before they can walk. So, to no surprise, some of the greatest herbologists, potioneers, and magizoologists in the world are Druids.

In recent years, education has been a triggering discussion with Druids. In 2000, Minister Kingsley backed the Department of Education in enforcing education rules and requirements for Druids. As such, they require Druid children to participate in the OWL and NEWT exams at Hogwarts each Spring. While this has been a way for Druid children to get to know other magical kids their age, it thoroughly upset the Druids to be forced to send their children 15-18 year old children to Hogwarts each Spring. They stay in Hogsmeade April and May, and return to Hy-Brasil the beginning of June. Druid children don't take "classes" during this time. They are there only to participate in the exams.

[b][u]Government[/u][/b]
As is explained below, Druids have the ability to enforce their own laws, and Ministry laws, on Hy-Brasil. They even maintain their own government. The leader of the Druids is chosen by the ancestors, known as the "High Druid". Below the High Druid, is the Druid Council, which is made up of 10 individuals, who are likewise chosen. Druids believe that their ancestors will help guide them, and so each summer, during the festival Litha (Summer Solstice), their leaders will gather and perform fire rituals. They will then release 10 magical fireflies into the festival. Whoever these 10 fireflies land on, are the new Council. Thus the council can change every year. Quite often, the fireflies will land on existing council members. They will rarely land on individuals under the age of 16, though it does happen from time to time(so no big worries of too young council members!). The High Druid is selected only upon death. When a High Druid passes away, the body is cremated, and a Golden Snidget is released into the night. Whoever the Golden Snidget lands on is the next High Druid (this process can take some time. The shortest recorded time for the bird to find a new High Druid was seconds, and the longest was 3 months. At which time, it landed on the crib on a baby born only hours before.) Again, while young selections are rare, it does happen from time to time. Druids don't argue the choices, as they believe the ancestors chose them for a reason.

The High Druid and council create and maintain order. They are in charge of approving visitors to their island, ruling over crimes, etc.

An added layer to this though is how these laws are enforced. Druids have their own appointed officers, which they call "Guardians". Guardians are basically the Aurors of Hy-Brasil. They enforce the will of the High Druid and Druid Council and protect Hy-Brasil. Among the Guardians is the High Guardian, who leads the Guardians as a whole. 

The High Druid and Council will appoint a Druid Advisor for the Ministry, as they see fit. This advisor is basically in charge of being the voice of the Druids at the Ministry. They will oversee all Druid to Ministry relations, and ensure the Ministry doesn't try to overstep their bounds. They will also ensure that any important information is relayed back to the High Druid and council. This position was created to satisfy Kingsley's Ministry while he was Minister.

[div style="text-align:center;"][b][u]Rules/Laws/etc[/u][/b][/div]Druids follow the basic Ministry laws. (example, no magic in front of muggles, don't kill, etc). In addition though, Druids have the authority to govern themselves. They have their own leaders, rules, etc. Ministry Aurors do not have any authority on Hy-Brasil, instead, Druids enforce their own laws, and laws relevant to them from the Ministry. Rarely will the Ministry interfere with Druid business unless absolutely necessary. Some laws that are different/enforced on Hy-Brasil are:
1. Underage Magic: Druid children do not have the trace. Druid children have their own form of schooling. Their schooling in general is rather unconventional for most European Wizardkind. As such, underage Druid children are allowed to use magic.
2. No Non-magical People: Druids are very VERY strict. If you don't have magic, you can't enter Hy-Brasil. Hy-Brasil actually has extremely powerful enchantments that repel non-magical beings. Even animals. 
3. No unauthorized visitors: The Druid leaders are very strict on the comings and goings of Hy-Brasil. While residents can come and go as they wish, non residents require special approvals (think of it like a Visa you have to apply for before you enter a country) before they are granted access.
4. No dark arts: The Druids do not, absolutely do NOT, tolerate dark magic of any kind. Even simple jinxes. They do not learn it, they don't allow it on the island from non-residents. No way. They will excuse a few mistakes (with strict punishments, cause kids don't always know better), but if an adult is caught performing dark arts it can result in banishment from Hy-Brasil. (Basically, dark druids can exist, they just better hope they never get caught, or they were banished and cast out of druid society).

[div style="text-align:center;"][b][u]Things to know when making a Druid[/u][/b][/div]-Druids will have a pureblood status exemption. Because they don't mix with non-magical beings (often. Might still happen on occasion, but it'll be crazy rare and they'll get in a lot of trouble from their Druid family) they have some of the purest magical blood in existence. The only time a Druid won't be a "pureblood" is if their druid parent broke tradition by being with a non-magical being, or a non-pureblood modern witch/wizard converts to their way of life and has kids.
-Druids do permit non Druid Wizardkind to convert to their way of life. These converts aren't Druid by blood though, and won't gain the skills of true Druids. Convert druids don't have to be purchased.
-Heaven forbid a Druid has a relationship with a non-magical person. They are FAR worse than American wizards when it comes to non-magical beings. The Druids will never permit the non-magical partner to enter their island. There may also be some serious discrimination going on for the children of such a union/the person that engaged with a non-magical being. 
-Druids know very little about non-magical society unless they go out to explore the world or someone that has explored the world tells them.
-Druid kids don't attend Hogwarts. BUT, when they are OWL and NEWT aged, they do go to Hogwarts April-May to participate in the exams.
-Dark druids are 100% real, and allowed. You have to purchase them like normal. They get all the perks. BUT you can never bring them to Hy-Brasil, as they've been banished from the Druid homeland.
