[div align="center"][font size="5" face="georgia"][i]7TH YEAR CAREER PLANS[/i][/font][/div][hr][blockquote][blockquote][font face="georgia"]As you should well know, students are required to talk to their heads of staff in their sixth year in order to determine their future career choices. All seventh years will be promoted to these jobs at their graduation.

[b]**The Lore team maintains this list so that when graduation happens at the end of each IC school year all 7th years can be moved into their careers immediately! If you don't post here for your 7th year and graduation happens, sora gets to have fun giving you random jobs**[/b]
