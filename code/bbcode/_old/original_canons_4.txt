[div align="center"][font size="5" face="georgia"][i]WIZARDING FAMILIES OF THE WORLD[/i][/font][/div][hr][blockquote][blockquote][font face="georgia"]
JK Rowling has supplied us with a plethora of surnames that exist in the magical world but we don't know much about.
 These families are entirely up for grabs for characters. So, a few ground rules about them, to start:

[ul][li]The first person to claim a surname is the 'creator' and gets to decide the basic family makeup. Parents, blood status (They do have to be half or pureblood. These are magical families so they can't be muggleborn.), siblings, history, etc.[/li]
[li]No direct descendants of characters we know died. You can make relatives of them though.[/li][/ul]
Please note: Purebloods are not common, and most wizards now a days are half bloods. So if you want a pureblood you have to take one of these names. &nbsp;There are&nbsp;a few exceptions listed in the rules though!

[font size="1"]To claim:[/font]
[code style="font-size:10px;"]name - let me know if you want strikethrough to close off name to be solely controlled by you or asterisk to leave open to other descendants made by other members[/code]
[div style="text-align:center;"]
[/div][div style="text-align:center;"][span style="font-size:10pt;"]* - family is used but open to more descendants.[/span][/div]

[div align="center"][font face="georgia" size="5"][i]SACRED TWENTY-EIGHT[/i][/font][/div][hr][div align="justify"][blockquote][blockquote][font face="georgia"][font face="georgia"]In the 1930s or 40s, an anonymous publication concerned with preserving the purity of bloodlines within the magical population was compiled, giving a compendium of the truly pure-blood families of the United Kingdom.&nbsp;The ‘Sacred Twenty-Eight’ would be embraced by Voldemort, despite being a half-blood himself, and sneered at by wizards who recognized&nbsp;that the wizarding world would have died out if their ancestors hadn’t married Muggles.

If it is crossed out it means the family has lost it's position in the "Sacred 28" since it's publication because of the male line being broken, or the family losing pureblood status. Red text specifies the status of the family in terms of descendants and if the family is in use.

[div style="text-align:center;"][span style="text-align:center;font-size:10pt;"]- - -[/span][/div]
[strike][b]Abbott[/b] – A grave belonging to an unknown Abbott was found by Harry in Godric's Hollow. Hannah Abbott was the first of her year to be Sorted and Hannah herself fought bravely during the Battle of Hogwarts.[/strike]
[font color="#e61919"]This family has lost its pureblood status. Descendants are half-blood.[/font]

[b]Avery[/b] – Mentioned by surname only in the Harry Potter books. An Avery had just stepped out of the room at the Slug Club party where Tom Riddle asked Professor Slughorn about Horcruxes. A Death Eater named Avery was also part of the ambush at the Department of Mysteries. He was believed to have ‘wormed his way out of trouble’ following Voldemort’s first defeat, by claiming to have been acting under the Imperius curse. 
[font color="#e61919"]This family has played playable character; please refer to the original canon list[/font]

[strike][b]Black[/b] – Sirius, Harry’s godfather, was the first of the Black family not to gain admittance to Slytherin. He later gave his family’s London house over as headquarters for the Order of the Phoenix, much to the chagrin of the spirits of his ancestors who haunt it. His brother was Regulus Black, a Death Eater who switched sides and tried to destroy a Horcrux, and among Sirius’s many cousins were Bellatrix Lestrange and Narcissa Malfoy.[/strike]
[font color="#e61919"]This family is extinct.[/font]

[b]Bulstrode[/b]– A particularly unpleasant Slytherin and early consort of Draco Malfoy, Millicent Bulstrode had a number of skirmishes with Hermione. The latter had a mishap with some Polyjuice Potion and one of Millicent’s cat’s hairs.
[font color="#e61919"]This family has playable characters; please refer to the original canon list.[/font]

[b]Burke[/b] – Caractacus Burke, one of the founders of sinister wizarding shop Borgin and Burkes, was seen by Harry in the Pensieve, buying Salazar Slytherin’s locket from Voldemort’s mother when she is left destitute and pregnant.

[b]Carrow[/b] – Amycus and Alecto Carrow were a brother-and-sister Death Eater double-act, recruited to instil some discipline at Hogwarts.

[strike][b]Crouch[/b] – Bartemius Crouch might have led a very ordered life were it not for his Azkaban-escapee and Death Eater son ‘Barty’ Jr, who killed him and transfigured his body into a bone. Barty used Polyjuice Potion to impersonate Mad-Eye Moody to lead Harry into the Triwizard Tournament trap.[/strike]
[font color="#e61919"]This family is extinct.[/font]

[strike][b]Gaunt[/b] – Quite where Voldemort got his meanness from is indicated from the portrait Rowling paints of his grandfather, Marvolo Gaunt, and his uncle Morfin. Obsessed with their own pure-blood status and with being the only living descendants of Salazar Slytherin, they terrorise Voldemort’s mother Merope, and accuse her of being a Squib. After a string of attacks on Muggles, the two Gaunt men end up in Azkaban, leaving Merope alone to enchant a local Muggle boy Tom Riddle – and we all know that didn’t end well.[/strike]
[font color="#e61919"]This family is extinct.[/font]

[b]Greengrass[/b] – Daphne Greengrass was a fellow student of Harry, Ron and Hermione, who only makes one appearance in the books. Draco Malfoy went on to marry Astoria Greengrass, a woman more tolerant of Muggles than her in-laws would have liked.

[strike][b]Longbottom[/b]– Neville Longbottom was one of Harry, Ron and Hermione’s best friends and a fellow Gryffindor. He was raised by his grandmother Augusta because his Auror parents had been so badly tortured by the Lestranges that they were confined to St Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. Longbottom killed Voldemort’s snake Nagini during the Battle of Hogwarts, playing a major role in the downfall of the Dark Lord. He later became Hogwarts Herbology professor.[/strike]
[font color="#e61919"]This family has lost its pureblood status. Descendants are half-blood.[/font]
