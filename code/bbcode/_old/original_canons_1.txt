On this Canon list we have five sections! For simplicity sake below is a break down of the sections. Each section also includes a notation of if it is, or isn't, canon. What this is referring to how much you can change about the family.&nbsp;&nbsp;

[b]Canon: [/b]Many parts of the character/family make up are set in stone. You can discuss changes with staff, but some changes might not be approved due to lore reasons.
[b]Not Canon:[/b] The family isn't established yet (wizarding family lists) so you can make them what you want, or a member made the family (original next gen) and may be willing to discuss changes if you reach out to them.

[/font][div align="center"][font face="georgia"][b]ADULTS[/b]
[/font]These are characters we saw during Harry Potter's schooling years, or people we know existed. We only list the UNAVAILABLE adults here, because there so many. These are canon.

[font face="georgia"][b]NEXT GENERATION[/b]
The kids of characters we knew existed in the series. These are canon.
[/font]
[font face="georgia"][b]ORIGINAL NEXT GEN[/b]
For those that made original families (or used a wizarding family name to create a family) that want to put their families up for reference. These are not canon.

[font face="georgia"][b]WIZARDING FAMILIES[/b][/font]
This is a list of names we have found in the books, movies, games, etc. Basically they exist, but we know little to nothing, so you can take them and make them your own. These are not canon.

[div align="center"][font face="georgia" size="5"]ADULT CANONS[/font][/div][blockquote][blockquote][font face="georgia"][hr]
This is for adult canons only right now. (Characters mentioned in the books, movies, or video games.)&nbsp; Because of how many adults there are in the world we've decided to only list those that are taken, or unavailable for some other reason.&nbsp;[/font][/blockquote][/blockquote]
