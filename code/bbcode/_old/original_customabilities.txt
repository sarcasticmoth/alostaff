[blockquote][blockquote][div align="center"][font size="5"]CUSTOM ABILITIES[/font]
[hr][/div]
[div align="justify"]As part of Alohomora's second anniversary, players were given the opportunity to 'unlock' custom abilities for one individual character. Now-a-days you can earn a custom ability by reaching your first year anniversary, or by purchasing it from the IC shop. So everyone is on the same page, here are the guidelines for custom abilities:

[ul type="disc"][li]Staff will message you when you have a custom ability with the approval process. The pm will include these guidelines and a template to use.[/li][li]Custom abilities require oneshots, just like special abilities. Basically just introduce yourself using the ability![/li][li]They can be applied to a current character or a new character.[/li][li]You don't have to redeem these abilities immediately. You can wait as long as you'd like before contacting the staff about claiming it.[/li][li]Once an ability is approved and applied to a character, it can't be removed.&nbsp;
[/li][li]If you drop a character with a custom ability you 'get it back' and can create a new custom ability, but will have to go through the approval process again.[/li][/ul][div][span style="font-size:13.3333px;"]
[/span][/div][ul type="disc"][li]If proposed ideas are too powerful, we will work with you to water them down, or come up with an alternative that works.[/li][li]These are primarily unique abilities (so only one of each), but there may be cases are duplicates are acceptable. Message staff if you'd like to have an ability that is already in use and we will let you know.&nbsp;[/li][li]If the character has a special ability or is a demi human you can use a custom ability to acquire a restricted part of the special ability or demihuman skill (example: Vampires can turn into bats but part vampires can't. A part vampire could use their custom ability to gain the skill of turning into a bat.). You can only acquire one skill (using the same example, vampires can also walk on walls. Part vampires can't have both turning into a bat and walking on walls, they can only have one.). In this situation it is not considered a 'custom ability' IC because they are skills that exist. (It is considered a custom ability OOC though.)[/li][li]Except for the previous mentioned special ability and demihuman situations, characters with special skills and demihuman status can't have custom abilities.[/li][li]Some custom abilities won't work on those trained in occlumency (the ability of mentally guarding yourself and keeping people out of your head/learning things about you.) unless the occlumens intentionally lowers their guard to let it work. As such, abilities state if occlumens are immune.[/li][/ul]

@astrid       - [b]Cryomancer[/b]
[blockquote]Astrid has the ability to manipulate snow and ice using her hands. There is a unique well of magic within her that she taps into when using this power, which is focused through her hands. When the well of power is depleted, exhaustion overtakes her and she will need a restorative sleep and meal. The manipulation is not all powerful - she cannot freeze people or use it too much without depleting the well. Music helps Astrid control this ability and not let it get out of hand, so she will often be found humming while using it. Signs that show Astrid tapping into the power include a faint blue light emanating from her hands and wisps of glowing, bluish steam around snowy/icy bits that she had manipulated. Astrid discovered the power when she was nearly six years old, first displaying itself when her normal magic started to appear. She is capable of producing balls of snow (which she often likes to make into playful snowmen) and icicles, especially when she is angry. The power is tied to her emotions, so in order to conceal her powers, Astrid has managed to internalise and lock away strong feelings, only letting them go when she is certain she can control them.[/blockquote]

@emrys           - [b]Hypnotist[/b]
[blockquote]Through eye contact he is able to convince someone to preform an action. Eye contact is necessary, his eyes flash a golden color as he uses the ability. He is not able to make someone do something that they wouldn't already do. He also must use soft and direct language. The state doesn't last long, so he must be concise. The weaker the mind the stronger his hold and the longer he can keep it.[/blockquote]

@hazel   - [b]Misdirection[/b]
[blockquote]Hazel has the ability to redirect magic, within certain parameters – essentially taking control of the magic and redirecting where it goes without changing the nature of the spell itself. She can only influence single target spells and charms, rather than those intended for multiple targets. The simpler a spell is, the more easily she can redirect it. The more complicated the spell, the harder it becomes, until she reaches a point where the magic won’t obey her at all. [/blockquote]

@jean           - [b]sensory tracking[/b]
[blockquote]-doesn't work on occlumens- 
It is the inherent ability to find things. Jean was born with an intrinsic, temporary bond to the objects and people he desires to find; from inanimate to blood relatives. If Jean has a sense of the item or a connection to somebody who desires the item, he may be able to locate it. The stronger the connection he has to what he is looking for, the more likely he is to find it. Though it is entirely personal. If Jean does not desire to find something, he will not be able to bond to it. Like an urge, or a tether, he feels a tug in the direction of the item. Using this instinct, Jean can follow it until he can see or acknowledge the object, which is when the bond terminates and he no longer feels the urge to find it any more. It is a very visceral bond when made. Jean can focus on very little else when he is looking for something, or following a tether. It is near impossible to break a bond once made and it can make him physically ill if he cannot discover it - depending on the strength of the bond. For instance, if he was looking for somebody who later died, the bond would be broken without completion and Jean could have a very adverse reaction. It is also not an ability without faults, nor is it entirely exact. Depending on what he is looking for, he may accidentally bond to a relating object or person without realizing it. The bond will still terminate once found, even if it is not exactly what he meant to find.&nbsp;[/blockquote]

@seph                      - [b]Magic Matrix[/b]
[blockquote]Heleen can see magic and with some effort identify what the magic she can see is. This is a slow process that requires a lot of concentration and time, as it is similar to hacking a computer for instance. The more complicated the magic is, the harder this becomes for her, the more risky it becomes and the more time identifying it would consume. She also faces physical repercussions from doing so. From getting tired to bloody noses, and if pushing far beyond her natural limits it can go all the way to more serious complications such as internal bleeding.[/blockquote]

@jimmie                                             - [b]Love Weaver (inherited)[/b]
[blockquote]-doesn't work on occlumens-
It's basically the same as her father’s except she can actually see the potential connections. She sees a string-like connection that connects potential matches. She can also see strong/deep platonic and familiar relationships. The more noticeable the thread, the deeper the relationship. It ranges from misty grey to pitch black. Like her father she is highly susceptible to vampire/veela allure. She can’t see connections/matches for part humans (vampire/veela/giant/goblin). She also can’t see threads connected to her relatives or herself.
[/blockquote]

@jimbo                                             - [b]Love Weaver[/b]
[blockquote]-doesn't work on occlumens-
He has a sixth sense that permits him to sense the ideals of a perfect partner. Jimbo can accurately match them with another person that is deemed to fit. He is basically a one man dating site, where all accounts of people he has listened to are put together and stored, allowing him to pick and choose the perfect partner, for you! While his success rate is extremely high, there are some faults. When put on the spot, he has trouble bringing up a potential partner. Deep, meditative thinking is necessary for a proper decision to be made. Written letters can also take a month or two to process, since he has to understand the feelings that the customer is portraying to him. That's difficult on paper, and thus takes longer. His ability is also completely useless on Christmas, New Year's Eve, during the entire month of February (funny right?), and with influencing magic such as love potions or the Imperius Curse. Demi-humans also give him extreme trouble, and veela and vampire allurement charms slow down his entire process. He is also highly susceptible to their woos.[/blockquote]
@luke                   - [b]energy drainer[/b]
[blockquote]Luke possesses the ability to drain the energy of any wizard who is in close proximity to him. He can drain their energy to the point of collapse but he needs to be careful because his own energy diminishes at the same rate. [/blockquote]


@maria                    - [b]pyromancer[/b]
[blockquote]Description of ability: Maria has inherited the Veela ability to create fire with her mind in her hands. SHe's also capable of throwing it/basic manipulation of the fire. Her hands are virtually fire proof (as that's where the fire appears), but the rest of her is not.[/blockquote]

@maxima                                             - [b]Healing Touch[/b]
[blockquote]Max has the ability to heal the minor injuries and illnesses with physical touch. Set and heal small bone breaks (fingers, toes, noses ribs, etc), heal muggle illnesses (these are simple for magic to heal), cuts, bruises, etc. She can not heal life threatening injuries or magical ailments.
[/blockquote]

@nova     - [b]Charmed Cooking[/b]
[blockquote]-doesn't work on occlumens-
Nova is able to accurately measure, cook, and create food through charms that not only tastes better than any normal food-related charm can do, but also induces an almost therapeutic calming effect. Essentially the potency of her charms are stronger when used for cooking/baking than they would for the average person. This is an inherited ability from her grandfather's side of the family and occasionally gets passed along.[/blockquote]

@ophelialee                                            - [b]Empathic Touch[/b]
[blockquote]-doesn't work on occlumens-
Ophelia, when concentrating can take away the mental and emotional pains a person is feeling, giving them peace of mind.  She is able to see the briefest of flashes of how they're feeling when she is taking away the emotions, and has to lie down after with a migraine.  The migraines' length and depth will depend on how bad the other persons emotions were at the time she helped them
[/blockquote]

@penelope                                       - [b]Ability Detection[/b]
[blockquote]-doesn't work on occlumens-
Penelope, when in close proximity to others, has the intuitive sense of whether or not another person has a magical ability outside of the established norms of the wizarding world (i.e. whether or not a person has a custom special ability, rather than something like Legilimency or Occlumency). She cannot, however, tell the nature of the ability or its limitations; she can only tell that a person possesses one, unless that ability has been otherwise shown or explained to her. The more people are around or the greater the physical distance between her and another person, the less likely Penelope is to be able to use her ability.
[/blockquote]

@zen                                      - [b]Vampiric Wall Walking[/b]
[blockquote]Vampire skill she's inherited. Zenevieva has the ability to walk on walls and ceilings regardless of the surface and angle. This was something she once envied her mother for being able to do, but is now rather frightened how it developed within her. Unlike what story tales may assume, Zenevieva cannot channel through herself to allow others to walk on walls or ceilings alongside her.

[/blockquote][hr][div align="center"][font size="4"]SPECIAL CUSTOM ABILITIES[/font][/div]
-These are members/characters that completed the 50k November challenge and earned a special custom ability, in which staff gave leeway to the above rules/restrictions. There may be future ways to earn one of these.-

@eeva         - [b]true animal affinity[/b]
[blockquote]Eeva's connection with animals is extraordinarily strong, even for a druid. She retains the natural affinities druids have with animals but she is also capable of openly communicating and understanding any animal she comes across. It works much like wizards with an animal affinity can, only she is not limited to a species. This also means that she can more easily train/tame/get animals to do what she says as she has this affinity and the druids natural affinity working in her favor.[/blockquote]

@mavis         - [b]Aura Reader[/b]
[blockquote]-doesn't work on occlumens- 
Mavis is able to see the aura of individuals. Auras appear as different colors, and represent different things. She can also read more the longer she focuses. On the surface, she can read a person's mood/emotions. With more concentration however she is able to distinguish blood statuses (muggle vs magical, wizard vs demi human, different kinds of demi humans, individuals with wizarding and demi human blood, etc), and also see aura scars (which are left by intense events that changed the person.). Aura scars don't necessarily tell her exactly what happened to the person, but she can tell if it was good or bad and just how traumatic the event was/how deeply it affected a person. Focusing too hard for too long can cause headaches, fainting spells and even seizures..[/blockquote]

@virvatuli       - [b]Dragon Animagus[/b]
[blockquote]Virva's animagus form is a Swedish Short Snout (dragon), rather than a common non-magical animal. She's capable of all things a normal dragon is capable of but retains her human mind when thus transfigured into her dragon form. [/blockquote]

@xiulan               - [b]Prophet[/b]
[blockquote]-doesn't work on occlumens-
Xiulan, unlike other Seers on the site, has an enhanced Inner Eye, such that she can also foresee true prophecies. The vast majority of the time, the prophecies are such that even Xiulan herself cannot decipher them, nor can she say with any certainty how far into the future such a prophecy might occur.

If a player wishes to involve their character in a prophecy or to use a prophecy as a plot element, that prophecy still must be cleared with staff in advance.[/blockquote]
