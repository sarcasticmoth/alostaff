[blockquote] 5’11”. He likes to style his hair a lot because it can be hard to tame without anything on it. Prefers looking spiffy while out and about. Keeping up a quality appearance means drawing more attention and showing people what he’s made of. It is not out of the realm of possibility for him to sometimes look like a stereotypical Canadian lumberjack. Some old habits are hard to shake.[/blockquote]

[b]overall personality:[/b]
[blockquote]Steve is still trying to figure out who he is exactly. He knows he can’t help drawing attention to himself, between his dashingly good looks and alluring vampiric voice, but sometimes it’s not as great as it seems. He goes with the being the ‘cool guy’ with lots of friends because that’s what comes naturally to him. Being surrounded by the upper echelon at school and feeling wanted by them serves its purpose for the time being. Being graced with this privilege, Steve can’t help but be a leader at times, and is known for making the right choices when it comes to the well-being of other people. In a way, that is the most ‘real’ part of him around the popular kids.

The side of him that wants to be protective and positive in himself is seen more around his family. Tricking them with his popularity is not only impossible, but futile. When around his twin sister, Nora, the two of them are known to utilize their vampire side to creep other students out, or to get things that they want. Most of the time they’re harmless pranks, but the ability to be who he wants to be around his sister makes up for everything that happens in his social life. 

Currently he’s attempting to break out of his cool dude role and move into the latter one, but that is proving to be more difficult than he thought. Having to move schools and being the new kid will only reopen old habits, and preventing himself from following through with those will probably be difficult. He knows how easy it will be to start with a clean slate once at Hogwarts, but also that it would be easier to fit in if he kept doing what he has always done. At least there’s an entire summer to plan for that. [/blockquote]

[b]history:[/b]
[blockquote]Nestled in the great northern pines of Canada lies a small wizarding community. And by northern Canada, like really far north. Its exact location isn’t all that important because it essentially only exists to suit the needs of those that want to stay away from everyone else (especially those crazy neighbors to the far south). It was here that a recently turned vampire, Fae, met her future husband. He seemed almost too perfect at first, considering the typical crowd of rejects that inhabited the community, and had a kickass Norwegian accent to boot. Wayne Kolstad was his name, and his job as an alchemist had led him to the remote town in order to continue his studies on the subject. He was extremely far away from home, and the fresh blood (figuratively and literally) around town was a nice change of pace from the lumberjack crowd.

Things moved quickly over the next few years, the only thing that got in the way being the sun and Wayne’s research, which sometimes had him locked up in a basement for weeks on end doing tests. After a few years of chasing the rather serious scientist, Fae won him over without the help of her vampire allurement. With very miniscule sunlight in the cold throes of the northern territories, little can be left to the imagination with a newlywed couple. What would normally have been one child was instead two children; twins – aptly named Nora and Steve. Fae had no problem handling two, tiny half-blood suckers, but it was soon apparent that Wayne was going to reach a limit at some point. He had no idea how to handle children, and preferred to only do things with them when necessary. That was how things went growing up, and still remain to this day. Married to his work more than his family.

Growing up was different for Steve and his sister than it was for the average children. Half-vampire aside, they also lived in a remote enough area that it was impractical to travel to the nearest magical school, or even to Ilvermorny in the United States. Their mother had wanted them to get an education there, their father preferring to send them to Durmstrang Institute, where he had studied. Both would have required an excessive amount of money for travel, and considering that there were two Kolstad children instead of one, it would have been even more difficult. The decision instead, was to join the coalition of other families that teamed together to semi-homeschool all the children in the town. Small as it was, the town was still large enough to maintain a magical school, bringing in enough outliers from other northern territories for it to work effectively. This allowed everyone in their community to get a normal no-maj education and a magical one. School was somewhat easy for Steve, though he preferred the attention other students gave him over the actual content of the classes, leading to grades slacking at times.

Outside of school, he enjoyed getting out into the wilderness and doing whatever he pleased. The necessity to remain true to his ‘school self’ was required on his own or with his sister. Hiking through the wilderness or fishing with his dad (on occasion, but also some of his greatest memories) took up the majority of his time not in school, as well as idolizing the Quidditch teams of Europe.

The decision to move to England was a difficult one. Society as a whole now allowed vampire integration more than ever before, but finding a job for Fae to take on was difficult. The Ministry allowed her to move in as a liaison for vampires and humans, seeing as her relationship with her husband and other human witches and wizards was practically unmatched. The initial choice was to send Steve and Nora to Durmstrang – similar to how it had been brought up years earlier, but the aftermath of the Triwizard Tournament left the Kolstads wary. Hogwarts was closer to London than Durmstrang, should something happen, and the magical school also had a better track record with students that weren’t one-hundred percent human. 

His first year at Hogwarts was an insane culture shock. Being dropped into curriculum that his classmates had been learning for the past five years with little help at the beginning made his first term at the school difficult. But Steve figured things out and was able to turn it around during the spring term.

[blockquote]Steve, unfortunately, caught Hag’s Fever early on, right near the end of the school year. Luckily that meant he was only out of commission for the first few weeks of his summer break. Making a full recovery, he bounced back like it had never happened in the first place. From there, he has since started his seventh, and final, year at Hogwarts.[/blockquote]
