[b]overall personality:[/b]
[blockquote] It’s not too difficult to describe Lily’s personality. Carefree, obsessive, a loose cannon, fun, exciting, crazy. All of those would probably work. To start, she doesn’t really care all that much about school itself. The studying and homework book isn’t all that interesting when there are literally people everywhere in the school that she could be fooling around with or talking to. This same carefree attitude (or carelessness under certain circumstances), means that things simply don’t bother her. Laughing at someone for hexing her or making fun of her might seem like a simple deflection tactic, like it would for most, but that’s simply not the case for her. Laughing is her way of showing she doesn’t care. Running off to do whatever she wants wherever she wants is prototypical, and is more than likely because her brain is going a million miles a minute. Something that was intriguing or interesting, or even the slightest bit shiny, could wind up with her attempting to climb a tree in the Forbidden Forest or sliding down railings on the moving staircases.
 
Her tomfoolery and general disregard for her own safety or well-being isn’t mirrored when it comes to friends or family, those being the closest to her are the ones she guards and protects the most. Keeping those she cares about close, Lily makes sure that they know she has their back no matter what the situation, leading her to constantly strive to be stronger so that she can be able to back that up if the time ever arises. Her obsessive nature lends itself here, showing her deep ferocity and love for the ones closest to her. Still, aggression and her want for power, not in the extreme sense, was what would eventually lead to one of her decisions in wanting to be a werewolf. In this sense, it might seem that her ideals are rather contradictory, but that’s just how she is.

Most would think that all this safeguarding and wild behavior was a side effect of being turned into a werewolf, but that simply isn’t true. Once Lily realized that she could get away with minimal consequences, she knew that this was the lifestyle for her. Becoming a werewolf was more a continuation of that, her goal of trying to achieve ultimate freedom and liberation that a human body couldn’t exactly do. Running through the forest on full moons without a concern in the world means more than anything to her. The question is whether or not she’ll always remain this way, or if there will be a point in time where being a reckless wild-child won’t be acceptable anymore. Right now those thoughts don’t even exist in her vocabulary, and hopefully never will. [/blockquote]

[blockquote] The final and best Potter child of them all, Lily was born in May 2007. Growing up a Potter was probably different than being any other young magical child at the time, always being in the spotlight for some thing or another. While the rest of the family might not have been too keen of it all the time, Lily soon realized she loved it, finding more enjoyment in doing what she wanted to do over what others wanted her to do. To say having the limelight shown on her childhood was simply the guiding light to this would be an understatement. It wasn’t so much that she wanted to stand out over her brothers, which she knew she did, but the attention was incredible. Being spoiled beyond belief, family is and always will be everything to her, despite disagreements with her brothers sometimes (it’s more fun to make fun of them though).

Eventually her 11th birthday rolled and later that year off to Hogwarts she went, just like her siblings and cousins before her. While Albus had been sorted into Slytherin the year prior, Lily was more than elated to join Gryffindor with James, which was exactly how things were supposed to go. School was okay. She didn’t like paying attention in classes, or showing up to them for that matter, only doing enough to pass but far from amazing. Socializing with so many other people her age was easily the best part of it all, everything else taking a back seat to the fun and games that ensued at Hogwarts.

Third year was a game changer for Lily. She discovered her classmate, Adrian Greyback, and the secret he held; he was a werewolf. She helped him keep this secret, studying up on the subject on her own and through her conversations with him about what being a werewolf was like. As far as she could tell, it was both one of the scariest and liberating experiences one could have. Come fifth year of school, and they hatched a plan for Adrian to turn her into one as well. Things went perfectly, at least in her eyes, but the rest of the Potter family hadn’t seemed too happy about it. By the next month and her first full moon, Lily knew exactly what Adrian had been talking about, and freedom and the strength to protect others was finally hers, albeit in the form of a vicious werewolf.

Out with fifth year, and the kidnappings and killings that were beyond her control, and in with sixth year, a few things have changed. While things in their world have changed, mostly for the worst, Hogwarts was still where fun was to be had, and Lily is still determined to protect her friends and family there from those that would oppose it. Not being able to enter the Triwizard Tournament was a bummer, but getting to meet and mess around with new people was a relatively fair trade off. She had been hoping to follow in her father’s footsteps, which probably wouldn’t have settled well with quite a few people, her parents included. The tournament brought other good things, like the Yule Ball, which she obviously knew she was going to with Adrian because that’s what best friends were for. Or was it more than that at this point? 

Seventh year was a mess. Her father’s disappearance over the summer weighed on her more than she thought it would, and what should have been her final two terms at Hogwarts, ended up with her failing virtually all of her classes. Lily was used to causing embarrassing situations and laughing them off, but she couldn’t do that this time. A decision was made between her parents and the school to have her repeat her seventh year again, the hope being that she wouldn’t have as much difficulty learning the same topics again as she had the first time around. The summer of 2025 was spent reviewing and trying to get a leg up on the classes she had done the worst in, and it seems to have worked. So far.[/blockquote]

[blockquote]Her father’s lengthy disappearance and then her aunt Hermione’s death over the summer have made Lily realize what mortality actually means. It hasn’t necessarily humbled her one-hundred percent, but she understands now that her actions can have consequences. Sometimes those consequences leave others hurt. The months following her aunt’s death have been somber ones, and Lily has decided to put as much focus on her time at school as she can, so that she doesn’t end up as the biggest failure in the family.
