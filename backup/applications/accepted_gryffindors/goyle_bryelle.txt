[b][i]overall personality:[/i][/b]
[blockquote]as a child, bryelle was a girl who usually remained quiet and obedient to her parents. but when the right age hit and bryelle finally took her parent's cluelessness into consideration, she soon began to change. with her brother practically raising her, his own traits rubbed off on the younger goyle, including his determination and unfortunately his wittiness or what others liked to call: being an asshole. as while renard was away at hogwarts, bryelle was reminded to keep her witty words (usually snide comments and a sharp silver tongue) to a minimum. though after enrolling into hogwarts, being sorted into gryffindor and meeting lily potter - things began to change...yet again.

soon disappeared the quiet person bryelle was and evidently, her confidence took a turn, reaching an all time high. though she came from a family of slytherins and was housed in what some call their [i]rivals[/i], the youngest goyle liked to believe she was a mixture of the two. brave and daring from gryffindor and cunning and ambitious like the snake - especially with her future career in mind. though, her attitude to things and people also changed once attending the wizarding school, resulting with the goyle girl living a care free life - refusing to stress about th and soon she was viewed as a loud mouthed person amongst others as well as a wild child, something her family - especially her brother - wasn't too happy with. although, mainly amongst friends bryelle is also known to have terrible mood swings. in her early years of hogwarts, the swings themselves weren't too bad but with the sudden rush of the ilvermorny transfers as well as all of the other events happening, they're more frequent. especially to people seeking help. bryelle hates repeating answers.[/blockquote]

[b][i]history:[/i][/b]
[blockquote]born on what was supposed to be a hot summer's day of two-thousand-and-eight, bryelle had always been told she came out kicking. and she did exactly that during her own birth. filling the home that belonged to the goyle's with loud screams of her presence, the second goyle child and only female was named bryelle rose goyle. with the pronunciation of bri-elle instead of bry-elle, the goyle's knew their mistake would follow them for life as the younger child grew. and well. it did.

having an older brother made life particularly easier for bryelle, as most of the pressure was left to him - to set an impression for the younger girl. which turned out to be rather well as bryelle ended up picking up his level of responsibility, sense of intelligence and immense sarcasm. at least around bry it was evident. although, renard had pretty much raised bryelle, due to her own parents lack of understanding and their sheer stupidity. having a four/five year age gap between the two of them allowed bryelle to understand things at a younger age, things that renard had come to understand much sooner than he should have. but nevertheless, the two bonded well - mocking their parents for the knowledge they lacked in.

although, when her older brother turned 11, that's when news stirred around the goyle's after her elder brother's sorting ceremony had placed him into Ravenclaw, different from the families long line of Slytherins - leaving bryelle worried for her own sorting four years later. but when the day came and the small tween sat upon the wooden high top chair, an oversized hat resting on her head and its mumbles leaving her in a world of confusion. bryelle recalls the moment when the hat yelled [b]GRYFFINDOR[/b], something that [i]nobody[/i] was expecting at all. when the news hit home, her parents were appalled, ashamed that another child didn't follow in the line of slytherins, especially because bryelle was housed into what some call their rivals. both of the goyle's parents protested to others who spoke of the sorting that both of their children had slytherin qualities and the hat was simply wrong. but looking back on it, bryelle realised she didn't care. she was glad she could be somewhat different from her parents and even ancestors. 

for the first year of Hogwarts, it took a while before bryelle was able to settle in comfortably, feeling lost and awkward without the aid of her brother. but by her third year, her place in the wizarding school had been set. she wasn't known as the Goyle's youngest child or Renard's sister any longer. to professors, she was known as the second worst troublemaker, with first place being handed to Lily Potter of course, while to others she was simply a wild child, ultimately leading to a self-teen rebellion. between the years from third to sixth, she achieved well enough grades to keep her parents off her back and even enough to keep her brother from being a mean bro about it. instead she put up with listening to about how she changed. 

friends were made and dropped, crushes came and left as they pleased and bryelle's sexuality was explored. but like any growing teen, she feared the future and what it would bring to her. but starting the new term as a sixth year, she knew what she finally wanted for the future. to be like her brother but not [i]exactly like him[/i]. somehow restore the family name through magical law - proving to others the two children weren't failures like the parents or to be ashamed of for breaking the line of slytherins. or to even develop the intelligence of those in the department of mysteries, considering mysteries were one of bryelle's many favourite things. 

but with the recent events hitting bryelle in the face, including the killings of Hogwarts students, explosions at King's Cross, followed by the explosions on the Durmstrang ship and the Beauxbaton's carriage, it became harder and harder to focus on studies. eventually came along the vandalism of Ilvermorny, the American wizarding school and surely enough bryelle was sure life hated her. now surrounded by both hogwarts students and the transfers, her own mood swings came at full throttle as simple and repetitive questions irritated her to the coil.[/blockquote]
[b][i]site events reaction:[/i][/b]
[blockquote]the events that england were met with had a big impact on bryelle. first came the deaths of the ministers of magic, which somewhat swayed her future choice to work in the ministry for her own safety but knew that she wouldn't enjoy a life without fighting for what she dreamed for. when the deaths of the hogwarts students arose too, bryelle was sure that life wanted her to suffer - especially since hogwarts was her second home for most of the years of her life. because of it, bryelle took her safety a little more...[i]seriously[/i]. only having fun or what professors call it: wilding out at the best of times. 

though, when news of harry potter's disappearance followed by the confirmation of his death was released in the papers, it affected bryelle but not too severely. harry potter was one of the people she once looked up to, aside from her brother of course so she tried to provide support to those she knew it would affect more: his family some who were actually bryelle's friends.[/blockquote]
