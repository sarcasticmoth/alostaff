[b]overall personality:[/b]
[blockquote]Fiercely proud and loyal, Brígh grew up always exploring. Which, of course would then explain her love for adventure. Easy to anger but quick to apologise, Bri will do anything to avoid confrontation. Getting the truth out of her can sometimes be difficult as she has a tendency to block things that make her uncomfortable out of her mind. Though she owns up to her own mistakes and tries to tell the truth to the best of her ability, if she finds something uncomfortable she will do anything to avoid it. She can get frustrated easily when she doesn't understand something, from laws of the land to a simple homework assignment. But she's unafraid to ask questions, even if she irritates her classmates in the process.

For all the convoluted mess that she is, Bri is spunky. She loves a good laugh and is charming in her own right. Often she can be caught in one of the many armchairs in the Gryffindor common room, quill hovered over parchment and a dreamy look on her face. It's these moments when she's wondering how to make other people happy. She gets lonely easily and prefers to be with at least one other person at all times. When she is alone, Bri starts to think of dark things, everything she has done wrong. While in the grand scheme of things, this is nonsense, Bri is concerned that the very trait that defines her, a fearsome temper, will be her own destruction. Terrified of losing her soul and failure, Bri covers her fear with an outwards projection of freedom and lightness.

Through trial and tribulation, Brígh has learned the hard way to stand up for what she believes in. Though she still detests confrontation, if it becomes a choice between that and what would be the coward's way out, Brígh will persevere and be a voice for those who cannot speak or be heard.[/blockquote]

[b]history:[/b]
[blockquote]Brígh O'Dalaigh was born the second child of Áine and Keir O'Dalaigh. The pair met in muggle London when Aine was leaving the pub and Keir was bustling off to a date at the Shaftesbury Theatre. It was an instant connection between the beautiful muggle and the strapping young wizard, especially when they realised they were both Irish. They settled in Galway and had their first child Bran when Aine was 20 and their second Brígh four years following. It was an exceptionally rainy winter night when Brígh was born, with Quay street flooding for the first time in years.

Bri's family always preached honesty. Her mother had been honest with her father about being a witch before they wed. Bri and Bran learned to always own up to mistakes and to tell the truth, because lies would always result in more trouble. The brother and sister were close from a young age, making adventures for themselves along the bay, seeing how long they could withstand the wind at Mutton Island. They were free to roam the streets as long as they were back by dark.

As Bran and Bri grew, so did their differences. Bran no longer wanted Bri to be a part of his adventures. He had new friends, better friends than his annoying little sister. No matter how angry she got, nothing changed. Bri had to have her own adventures, though every so often she would try to get back in with Bran, always failing. It became even worse when he went off to Hogwarts and Bri was left alone. Her classmates thought she was odd, though her parents always insisted otherwise. When they said Bri was too stubborn, that Bri would never let anything go, that she was annoying, she was assured that she was just different.

Bri managed to make a small, close circle of friends. But they weren't quite as interested in mucking about on the shore of the bay or trying to withstand the gale force winds. They were more concerned with getting the perfect instagram, which Bri was completely uninterested in. Her family didn't use much technology apart from her father, being witches and wizards. But Bri never said anything, glad at least to have some people accept her.

Finally, Bri got her Hogwarts acceptance. She was over the moon to join her brother, and was even sorted into the same house. She found she got on much better with people when she could talk about magic rather than having that massive weight on her shoulders. She was happy and at Hogwarts, and everything seemed perfect. She melded with the crowd, and managed to keep herself in check. She didn't want bursts of uncontrollable magic spurting out of her like lava. She found like-minded individuals who believed in the same things as her.

Things changed halfway through her sixth year at Hogwarts. Brígh's father fell terribly ill, enough to warrant her immediate removal from school at her mother's terms. If her father were to pass away, Brígh would want to be there anyways. She spent the entirety of 2025 at home, her mother giving her lessons as they nursed her father back to health from his mysterious illness. Regular muggle doctors were at a loss, and healers had no response. Though her father regained his health, the O'Dalaigh family are still cautious. Who knows if it could come back? But with her father's health restored, Brígh was allowed ro re-enrol at Hogwarts for the second half of her seventh and final year.

[b]site events reaction:[/b]
[blockquote]At the start of Brigh's fourth year, the minister of magic had been murdered. While that was big news, Bri and her family weren't directly affected. When a muggleborn student was killed on the Hogwarts Express, Bri was shaken. It could have been anyone. It could have been someone she'd known. She thought back to when she had been a first year, so excited for Hogwarts. She couldn't imagine having that taken from her. Throughout her fourth year, fear spread throughout the castle. People didn't know who to trust. Brígh was determined to fight the good fight, and when she heard rumour of a student led organisation that aligned with her cause, started by her housemate and somewhat friend James Potter, she joined up. Phoenix Rising quickly became a huge part of her life, even though it was disbanded shortly after James' graduation.

The drama came to a head when a Slytherin seventh year was discovered to be behind the killings. Bri hadn't known her, but Bran had been in her year. He never answered Bri when she asked about him. It seemed then that things would go back to normal, now that the murderer was gone. The Triwizard Tournament was reinstated, and Bri dutifully cheered for the Hogwarts Champion. When dozens were left dead from explosions at the departure of the foreign wizards, terror reigned once more. As the students went home for the summer, Bri included, she wondered what she could have done to stop it

When the Ilvermorny students joined Hogwarts in her sixth year, Brígh was quick to befriend a new Hufflepuff called Eli. They did near everything together, from wandering amongst the forest trees to cleaning up the Great Hall post feast. But when she pulled out of Hogwarts for spring term, they lost touch. Brígh managed to avoid catching Hag's fever, and never had an interest in Quidditch, though she was devastated by Hermione's death as an icon of her own. Since her death, Brígh resolved to face her problems like Hermione had, to be a voice for the voiceless and to stand up for what was right.[/blockquote]
