[blockquote]jimmie's biggest wish is to be appreciated for all she is. she feels somewhat overlooked as a female firstborn with no love-weaving ability, though she'd never admit to as much. outwardly, it's a lucky break. jimmie wishes to prove her father wrong, and find fulfilment and success as a blishwick in a career that doesn't involve weaving love.

[blockquote]jimmie's biggest fear is to amount to nothing. though her father wishes for her to take up the blishwick mantel, she can't ever see it being her own. jimmie just wants to prove any naysayers that she is worth the blishwick name - not for what they assume - but for better. she wants money, and security, and ownership of her own fate.[/blockquote]
[b][i]overall personality:[/i][/b]
[blockquote]Jimmie has always been outspoken. Even before she could talk she was babbling with conviction. A girl with big opinions and a pride easily picked upon, she is everything she wasn’t supposed to be. And Jimmie believes it was all by design. Love just isn’t on the cards for her, so she may say. And all the better for being so, because love made you… stupid. It made you weak. It took a man like her father, who dealt it like casino chips, and destroyed a part of him when it took her mother. As far as Jimmie is concerned, love is a distraction. And, deep down, it isn’t real or essential. She often makes this known to her father, even if only to see him disapprove. Though she doesn’t believe in the wonders of romantic love, Jimmie does love her father - in all his flaws… Having been raised by him alone since she was six, she admires his strength as much as she hates his job. 

Although, peel back a layer or two, you may find that deep down, Jimmie is bitter and afraid. She looks at her father and see’s that all he has is his business and his ability. That falling for someone means leaving yourself open to losing them. She doesn’t want that for herself. For her, that would mean laying aside her very own desires. She disagrees that this is vain and selfish, though in many ways it is. At just sixteen she doesn’t see things as complex as they are. She see’s her father pushing people together, and see’s a lack of control in it. Giving away something for something that, to her, is lacking in many ways. 

Seriousness aside, Jimmie is like her father. She loves to laugh. Not afraid of a little humour, a bit of back-and-forth, she’s quick to side with sarcasm and uses it liberally. Her favourite pastime is making fun of the family business, sometimes at her father’s expense. But, godforbid you laugh and ask her to get you a match. Jimmie won’t talk business, not even if you paid her. In fact, she’s quick to a temper if pushed about the Blishwick Match-Making Services. Even if she does cave and man the information lines when her father’s down an employee, or she needs the money for new clothes. You don’t… talk… about it. 

Speaking of tempers, Jimmie has a fairly bitter one. With a starving ambition, Jimmie can appear high strung when on a new obsession. She doesn’t like to be wrong, and she doesn’t like to be told what not to do or do. She takes this aggression out with casual Quidditch - a beater with a bitter swing. Off the pitch, she can be snappy and cranky if she feels in that particular mood. Usually around peak matching times. Overall, Jimmie has a lot of growing to do. And there’s room for it, too. No matter how stubborn and selfish she can be. There is a softness for the people she cares about. She’s a ride or die kind of girl who just doesn’t know who she wants to be. Only what she doesn’t want to be.[/blockquote]

[b][i]history:[/i][/b]
[blockquote]The day Jameson ‘Jimmie’ Blishwick was born was not a day of love. No matter that her father was a  name proclaimed master of it, or that she was pushed from a woman who loved her. She has never wanted any part in the icky stuff, and by extension, no part of the famed Blishwick empire. And it all began, perhaps, with the fact that she was never supposed to be born a girl. Who names their kid Jameson, you may ask, as Jimmie did as a child. Why a man who wanted a Jimbo, not a Jameson! At least, by name and gender. She was after all, as the story was often told, named after the beverage he had been gorging on the moment she was crowned female. 

For all who dare not know, Jimmie Blishwick is the daughter of the famed match-maker, Jimbo Blishwick VI. A legacy in business and ability. For the first born men in the Blishwick line were all blessed with that ‘special touch’. An inherit sense to see, with knowledge and understanding, who might love whom. And, until she was born, every Jimbo had had a Jimbo to pass this skill and business on to. And, though she was born loved, Jimmie always felt the stink from the Blishwick’s. She was the girl who broke a strain of fortune. A bad luck charm. But, rather than resent her very own gender, Jimmie grew to resent love instead. 

At the very least, you may say, if gender was the problem then why couldn’t her mum and dad simply… try again. Well, that’s a story Jimmie doesn’t like to tell. Because even though she hated love, it wasn’t taught, she was adored. And oh, how Jimmie loved her mother. Even as a child, she would follow Charlotte Blishwick around. A nurturing woman who was always there to remind a young Jimmie that girl or boy, she had just as much right to the Blishwick name. And she was all the better for breaking that ‘silly manly tradition’ of firstborns and luck. But, that childish infatuation would be broke when Jimmie’s mother got sick. Dragon pox, they said. At just six, Jimmie thought her mother held up the earth. So, when she died, it sort of felt like the world fell down around her. Or, so she imagined. Because as she grew those memories faded. And with it, maybe, came an almost infamous glory to what remained of her. A whiff of perfume. The echo of a hearty laugh. Jimmie knew her father felt the loss, maybe more so, because he remembered more of her. Which she found a way to resent as well. 

However, Blishwick’s persevered. They hadn’t lasted as long, or overcome scandal to be taken down easily. And Jimmie didn’t feel at all neglected being raised by a single-father. In fact, it probably attributed to her ferocious need for independence. She was given a lot of that growing up. Her father worked, and sometimes she went with him. Other times she was left with family members. All whom spoke very highly of her father’s ‘noble’ work. But, as soon as Jimmie could fathom the great scope of the Blishwick Matchmakers, she decided quite firmly that she hated it all. 

It might have been that fact that, according to many a Blishwick - bar her father - she was a blight on the family tree. After all, the last six generations of firstborns had all been male, and had all been given the gift. Never supposed to be a girl, it was a streak of good luck broken by a single gender. Of which was often conveyed to her by others. With a sad, if bitter, tone of voice. Pressed upon even more so by the simple fact that, as the years went by, Jimmie didn’t show a single inclination for love weaving. She didn’t feel the encroaching gift. And she’d tell any person who would listen, that she felt extremely grateful for the fact. A lucky break, she called it. Jimmie Blishwick would have you know that she hated love in its every form, especially when arranged by the Blishwick Business. Though deep down… very, very deep down, she was resentful of the things she couldn’t change and the way she was seen because of it.

One thing she could rely on, of course, was her letter and admittance to Hogwarts. At the very least, she hadn’t also ruined their good wizarding name in that sense. Just five years after losing her mother, Jimmie joined the ranks at Hogwarts and she thrived. It was a school with so much to offer that a girl with as much energy as Jimmie was kept somewhat entertained. She’d always been inquisitive, and she’d always had an appetite to succeed. Her occasional dismissal as a Blishwick meant sometimes, Jimmie looked to prove herself in other ways. She didn’t want to be a match-maker, so what did she want to be? A dancer, she wanted the elegant and lithe frame of a dancer. A swimmer, dive the great lake, but that meant getting her hair wet and she was quite particular about her appearance. And then it was a tea-reader and all things cosmic and psychic. Which didn’t last long, it turned out reading tarot cards was a little close to reading matches. So it was scraped. But, no matter how much she tried to remove herself from the Blishwick destiny, she always that clever curiosity. Rather than address it, she tried throwing herself in to the wonders of magizoology, but she never did have the patience for getting her hands dirty - and creature fur is a bitch to get off of robes. Most recently, in fifth and sixth year, Jimmie has seen the state of the world and decided it just won’t do.

Though young when the first attacks occurred, she wasn’t dumb enough not to notice the change in the air. Saw it in the set of her father’s shoulders. His vicious desire to make love and connections out of the creeping misery. Jimmie, typically, wasn’t as inclined. She joined the student paper. Decided that injustice, even in the smallest of ways, should to be addressed and fought against. Every plight was one she wanted to know about, and was ready to stand up for. If only to hear the sound of her own voice sometimes. After the terrifying kidnap of students, and the following attack on King’s Cross, Jimmie’s fear and lack of understanding is what drove her. Even so young. But, she continued to think  small time. Lately, however, after the events of the Tri-wizard Tournament and the following attack on the departing students, of which caused panic and uproar throughout the country, Jimmie realized that if she wants to make a mark she needs to delve deeper. That meant spreading the word, and joining the ranks of those rebelling against the likes of the Purifiers. Worse yet, she is to see her school twice is full because of it all, as the papers declare Ilvermony destroyed and Hogwart’s opening its gates to wayward students. Jimmie has never been the best at sharing. Truthfully, though, even with this deep desire bubbling inside of her, Jimmie is somewhat astray. From the rubble, she thinks she wants to be a hero. But, it’s as subject to change as her personality. Only time will tell, they say.[/blockquote]
