[b]appearance:[/b]
[blockquote]Simon looks identical to his playby Jeremy Allen White. His vampire attributes are pale skin, long limbs, and very small fangs; as well as towering height. He stands at just barely under 6'0", with a strong jawline and cheekbones. He isn't someone that has a smile plastered on his face, most people think he's unapproachable, when in reality he suffers from severe RBF (Resting Bitch Face). Simon has bright blue eyes surrounded in thick lashes. 

His sense of style can be best described as a low maintenance, grunge look, when he's not adorned in his school robes. He has random tattoos scattered across his body that he has gotten throughout the years out of impulse. Some have stories, but most of them have no meaning to him and it annoys him when people assume every tattoo needs a 'meaning'... He can often be seen with a skateboard under his arm.[/blockquote]

[/blockquote][b]overall personality:[/b]
[blockquote]Simon is the kind of person you can never tell exactly how he's feeling. The expression on his face is typically neutral, which people mistake for him being angry or annoyed. Unfortunately, he can't control what his face does when someone says something he thinks is stupid. His peers have said that he's a pessimist, but he feels that he is more of a realist when it comes to life. Simon won't pretend that he likes someone, or force small talk to fill in the awkward silences, he simply won't waste his time doing anything he doesn't want to do. This is his attitude when it comes to just about anything, especially school. He has book smarts, he just doesn't choose to use them due to laziness or simply not caring. Usually it's a combination of both. His head is typically in the clouds and he's a bit of a daydreamer, with a bit of a 'anywhere but here' attitude. Simon is a thrill seeker, enjoying heights, running from responsibilities, sneaking out at night, and skateboarding on campus where not permitted. 

Simon doesn't have a large social circle and he typically prefers to mind his own business. However, he won't stand for bullying and isn't one to sit back and watch injustices. He will try to use words first, but he's a bit of a loose cannon if he feels that someone is wrong, and he isn't against fighting. Simon has a short fuse and is easily annoyed by people. He's impatient and impulsive, constantly testing his boundaries with authority. Simon isn't afraid to make enemies, but he's typically kind and chivalrous towards his peers, especially girls. He enjoys the female anatomy and doesn't have trouble talking with the opposite sex, young and old. Simon has become quite the unintentional charmer over the years, finding flirting and wooing ladies unintentionally easy. [s]Most likely a vampire trait.[/s]

There are times that he gets intense cravings for blood, which could only be satisfied with a visit to the hospital wing to get a fix. He's open about being dhampir and if anyone has a problem with it he's  willing to discuss. Ignorance doesn't sit well with Simon. He's quick to put people in place if they bark up his tree, or if they bully with another vampire (or creature in general). Simon doesn't try to be a 'hero' in these situations, but if no one else will stand up for what's right, he will. Most of the time he prefers to stay quiet, not wanting to waste the energy on stupid people unless if they need to be taught a life 'lesson'. Excessive sun exposure is an issue at times, leaving him with painful sunburns.

Simon enjoys playing quidditch but has been on and off of the Gryffindor house team twice because he has trouble keeping his marks high enough to play. He has the hidden ability to lick his elbow and moon walk, which have both become great party tricks.

[b]history:[/b]
[blockquote]Simon Svendsen hails from a small wizarding village on the outskirts of Odense, Sweden. Starting at a very young age, he was exposed to the magical world and his families abilities. The Svendsen family consists of Simon and his fraternal twin, Sofia. They were the only offspring of Esther and Luka Svendsen, and were considered miracles. Before they were born, Esther was informed that she had a high risk pregnancy, which prepared her for the worst before they had arrived. When the day came, they were blessed with two strong and healthy newborns - Simon being the oldest by 45 seconds. Luka, a registered full vampire, and Esther a Pureblood witch, deemed their children 'Half-Vampire'. Esther wanted her children to be proud of their vampire traits, teaching them to never hide or shy away from their 'gift'. She didn't want them growing up thinking that they were 'different'. Although, they were, in the best sense, not that everyone in the wizarding community agreed with this.

 Soon after the birth of their the twins, Esther begged Luka to change her to a vampire. She desperately wanted to be like the rest of her family. Esther carried his only children, and he loved her and wanted nothing more than for her to be happy, but he couldn't fulfil that request. 'Changing' someone into a vampire was much more complicated then just biting someone. It involved dying and drinking a vampires blood... Since she was perfectly healthy, he urged her to wait. They fight about it frequently still, sixteen years later. She's upset that she's aging, while Luka physically appears to be in his early 40's.

Simon grew up in an upper-middle class household. His parents provided a comfortable childhood for him and his sister, building a relationship on trust and first hand experiences. The Svendens ran a very Laissez-Faire household, allowing mistakes to happen and rewarding them for taking chances. From year one through three, Simon attended Durmstrang. Year four was when his life changed. His family uprooted their lives from Sweden and moved to London. Simons parents launched their business, Flying Cauldron Company. They created their own alcoholic butterbeer concoction and moved to London for their business. The business is currently booming, always hiring fresh faces for the distillery and restaurant on site. Since the start of the business, the Svendsens have moved into a large estate on the outskirts of London and have more money than they could spend. Who knew alcoholic butterbeer would be such a hit?

On Simons first day at Hogwarts, he met his best friend, Rosie. From the first day he met her, he's had a pathetic school boy crush on her. It started off as a slow process, but now he's so infatuated with her, it's driving him crazy. Some days he thinks he may [b]love[/b] her, which freaks him out. He's too afraid to do anything about it in fear of looking like an idiot, and it seems that everyone but her knows how he feels. Whenever anyone brings up the subject, it gets him all weird and moody. Simon has snogged a handful of girls but he's never had an 'official' girlfriend. Girls tend to like him, but he's too afraid of getting hurt to bring anything to the next step. He's not a commitment-phobe, he just has his eyes set on a special girl. 

Since arriving at Hogwarts, Simon has found an interest in duelling and playing quidditch, his preferred position being Chaser. Academics have never been a focus of his, he just barely does enough to get by with a passing grade; if he could get away with less he certainly would. He's had a difficult time keeping his spot on the Gryffindor team because his grades are so inconsistent, which has been frustrating and embarrassing for him. Simon is an active member of the Art Club and is currently upholding a spot on the Gryffindor house team. When Simon graduates from Hogwarts, he hopes to pursue dreams of becoming a tattoo artist.

[b]site events reaction:[/b]
[blockquote]Simon has never been a fan of crowds, so the overcrowding of Hogwarts has been a bit of an annoyance, but he understands the circumstances. The extra bodies in the castle has made it hard for him to focus in class. There's a lot going on, everywhere. He hasn't taken any responsibility of being a 'welcoming committee' to any transfer students unless if it's a pretty girl, or someone that desperately looks like they need help. He hasn't been personally affected by the attacks, nor is he really concerned. Killings and dying aren't a concern for him considering the vampire half of him is already deemed "undead being" anyways. Simon isn't afraid of dying.[/blockquote]
