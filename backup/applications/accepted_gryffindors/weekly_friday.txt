[blockquote]10 and half inches, Sycamore wood, Thunderbird tail feather core.
Description: It looks beat up as it used to be the wand of his birth father, so it's seen plenty of use from it's previous owner.&nbsp; With the carving RF (Robert Faraday) on the bottom of the handle. A very demanding wand from core to the wood it is made of. Much like Friday, it craves adventure and excitement.

[b]appearance:[/b]
[blockquote]Friday looks much like his playby, standing 5'11" with black hair. Typically dressed in casual clothes that aren't name brand. Even though coming from a wealthy family, his clothes tended to always get messed up somehow from having fun, exploring or just being active. So, expensive clothes just seemed like a waste to him. Preferring free fitting outfits he didn't have to worry about damaging.

[blockquote]For the longest time, Friday didn’t have much of a goal in life besides having fun and that’s still very much the truth on the fun part. He just wants to be happy and keep the people around him happy. Yet after learning the fate of his birth parents, he’s decided to take a more proactive attempt as his school work. To one day be a member of whatever law enforcement department is in charge of catching magical animal traffickers and poachers. As well as people who just hurt animals. part of him also wished to become an accomplished duelist.

[blockquote]Friday has a fear of lizards and he doesn’t know why. He likes snakes and has even touched a couple but lizards freak him out more than anything. Something which certain members of his family love to bring up from time to time. He’s tried getting over it but just the way they move and their little legs creep him out. Yet he’s fine with dragons. Just little lizards concern him.

Aside from that is the lesser fear that as he becomes older he'll get boring, like many older adults he has met in his life. Still, some seemed interesting enough so he hopes to escape a life of boring staleness when he reaches his golden years. 

[/blockquote]
[b]overall personality:[/b]
[blockquote]Friday isn’t one to ever be serious unless the situation truly demands it. Which is rare as it takes a lot for him to switch from just goofy off to caring about a subject. It would typically have to involve a family or friend needed his help. Even then he’d still be full of wise cracks, jokes and teasing even while helping. Which generally annoys some of his siblings, something he’s aware of and enjoys immensely. He normally knows when to stop pushing buttons but has gone a little far at times with a joke or prank and gotten in trouble before. Life is meant to be enjoyed to him and anything else is just boring. It’s been claimed he does a lot just for attention but it’s all for fun, the attention is just a happy accident.

Friday also dislikes being still for too long and has been known to just up and disappear for awhile. Not so much running away as just spending a few days else where. At first his family worried that he ran off but he always turned up. Typically to scolding and a punishment but Friday didn’t mind. It’s one of the few things he does like to do alone, explore and find new places. A weird quiet contrast to how normally loud and busy he lives his life. Yet it balances him out he thinks, even if people start to worry when leaves. He gets a little kick out of that too.

Under all that goofing off and jokes lies a competitive streak. He dislikes losing more than anything. Part of the reason he took up dueling, to fill that competitive need he had. Quidditch was nice enough but dueling had more of a thrill to it for Friday. It wasn't a team activity, just a one on one battle with a clear winner due to their own actions and skills.

[b]history:[/b]
[blockquote]Friday was actually born as Benjamin Faraday, his parents were both loving magizoologists who cared for all creatures. In particular, their work revolved around the study, care and protection of Thunderbirds. Like many magical creatures, MACUSA had issued that they were a protected species. That didn’t stop traffickers and poachers from attempting to take the Thunderbirds or just kill them and take the usable parts. After his birth, his parents took time off to spend with their new child. In the downtime and with less protection than normal there was an increase in attempts to hurt the Thunderbird population. 

When Benjamin turned one they returned to work fully while Benjamin was left at a magical daycare. They would never return to pick him up. They both had been killed by poachers on their first day back. Defending the creatures they loved so much. Benjamin had an uncle on his father's side but he didn’t have the time nor wanted a child to watch over. With no other relatives, Benjamin was sent to a magical orphanage to be cared for until he was adopted or old enough to be on his own.

Benjamin didn’t spend much time at the orphanage before he was quickly adopted just before turning two by the weekly family. His new mother was an actress and his father was the executive of a calendar company that some ancestor started. He was renamed to Friday Knight Weekly, being just two he didn’t have much say or know what was going on either. He was just happy to be around his new parents who were very caring if just a little busy. Friday also had four other siblings. All near his age and were adopted as well aside from one. Life was nice for Friday.

Friday continued to grow up in the weekly household as they adopted more children when he was eight they adopted two more children, renaming them Saturday and Sunday. Friday was happy to have more siblings, it just meant it was more friends for him and life could be more fun. He also came to enjoy the company of the many animals they were allowed to have. Each child seemed to be allowed a pet of their own. Friday couldn’t decide as he just loved all animals the same. Still, he was always drawn to the magical creatures rather than the No-maj ones.

While all the children were adopted from a magical orphanage it was still exciting to watch as the older siblings got their letters to Ilvermorny. He was ten when two of his siblings, Monday and Wednesday got their Ilvermorny letters. Just one year off and he couldn't wait to go.

While he just expected Monday and Wednesday to come back from Ilvermorny his parents decided to adopt one more child. Naming this one Tuesday. While still close to the same age, Tuesday was already at Ilvermorny at the time. He was disappointed he wouldn’t be an older brother this time but still accepted more siblings and friends into his life. 

Unsurprisingly but still excited, Friday received his letter to Ilvermorny and before he knew it he was off. Friday was sorted into Thunderbird which just felt right to him like he was supposed to be there. everything about the house sounded great to him and his sister Wednesday was already there after all. The next few years went by quickly for Friday. He made plenty of friends and had even more fun with his life. Which did get him into trouble at school from time to time but he didn’t mind the detentions. He was happy and so were the people around him. 

During the summer of his fourth year, Friday received a rather large package from a name he didn’t recognize. It was filled with photos and books. Some of which seemed like journals and the photos were of a couple and a few with a child. As well as a wand that almost leapt into his hand when he reached for it. One more thing, a letter was with the package that explained that these were personal items from his birth parent's estate as his uncle had finally sold it and anything else with value. He left some remark that he was keeping the profits but Friday didn’t care about the money one bit. 

He spent most of the summer picking through the journal and photos in his room. Only coming out for food to take back to his room. To his siblings and parent, it seemed unhealthy for Friday to be locked in his room so often, unaware of the items he had received. Friday finally left his room much the same person he always was but with a greater understanding of where he came from and who he wanted to be one day. Also with the knowledge, he had been and was loved by two sets of parents now.

[b]site events reaction:[/b]
[blockquote]While Friday heard of a few of the things that were befalling the UK magical community he never paid much attention. Sure, it sounded terrible but it didn’t concern him at the moment so he wasn’t going to dwell on the sad news that came to him from time to time. That changed during his fourth-year summer as Ilvermorny was vandalized and left in a state of disrepair. The time to fix it was unknown which meant the students of Ilvermorny needed a new school. Hogwarts opened their doors and while Friday was excited about the move he would miss his old school. 

Now with the issues of the UK and Hogwarts being his concern more then when he was in America he still doesn’t pay too much attention. He doesn’t like the idea of criminals just running free or the recent outbreak of Hag fever. Friday doesn’t plan on letting any of that ruin his good times if he can help it.[/blockquote]
