[blockquote]nora looks like her playby with the same harsh cheekbones and curly brown hair. however, she is a quite bit more pale considering she is half vampire. she dresses in practical, cute clothes that one would expect a small town girl to wear. lots of sweaters, vests and collared shirts with short skirts and tights. the hogwarts uniform is going to suit her very well.

[b]overall personality:[/b]
[blockquote]Nora is a jock and a bookworm. She runs, plays baseball, hunts and hikes. Her favorite activity is hunting. She honestly would have been fine with being a full vampire and hunting all of the time, but she doesn't necessarily want to kill people so this works for her. She likes the chase, likes the rush and most of all likes the power of a gunshot.

Nora likes being surrounded by people, but doesn't make friends with everyone. She's picky and particular about those she spends her time with on a regular basis. She likes people who can make her laugh and joke around with her. She can be quite judgmental and snobby when she wants to be. She loves to freak people out with her alluring vampire voice and by saying things in unison with her twin brother. She loves scary movies and books, anything that can give her that adrenaline rush of fear and excitement.

When in real life danger, however, Nora takes this very serious quite suddenly. She hasn't been in any incredibly scary situations yet, but when in that sort of situation she is most likely to freeze up, needing someone else to act first before she'll snap out of it and help out. As much as she loves her guns, she'll most likely use wit and words to get out of a sticky situation. Unless that situation is with a real violent being, then she'll definitely fight hard. She isn't a trained duelist, though, and doesn't consider herself incredibly skilled in offensive magic. But wizards can die from gunshots, too.[/blockquote]

[blockquote]n/a[/blockquote][b]history:[/b][blockquote]Fae, a lovely Vampire who was turned at the prime age of thirty, living in a small wizarding community in the northern pines of Canada. It was so far north and so remote that it was an easy place for a vampire to live and being in a wizarding community was the best place for her. While there, she met her now husband, Wayne Kolstad. Having moved from Norway, Wayne came to Canada to practice his alchemy in private. After some pursuing on Fae's end, they were married. Soon the newly weds had twins, Steve and Nora, half vampires.

Wayne never considered himself meant to be a father, and didn't really know how to interact with children. He only did things with them when he had to and mainly just focused on his work, his wife, and providing. Fae was protective and often overbearing, this was how Steve and Nora lived their lives.

They lived in an isolated town, far enough from any large magical schools that the parents of the community had to consider if they could afford sending their kids away for wizarding school. Most parents came to the agreement to co-homeschool their children in the town and other children from towns nearby came as well to form a small, unofficial school for magic.

Nora and Steve were popular among their friends. Steve was incredibly well liked from day one of his life, and Nora followed suit. She was picky with her friends, though, but just the ones she kept close. Nora studied hard and learned a lot about magic, but mostly she learned about 'monster hunting'.

She was technically a 'monster', according to muggle standards, she knew that. But she quickly fell in love with monster books and movies, whenever she could get her hand on a movie. She also learned to hunt, as did basically every kid who grew up in Canada. She and her brother would hike and camp and explore the mountains and woods. During these times, Nora became incredibly comfortable with hunting rifles.

As for the vampire side, she didn't mind having to drink human blood. They had to get it special from a blood bank, since their mother said they weren't eh kind of vampire that 'hunted' people. That was fine with Nora, she didn't want to kill anyone anyway. But she still longed for that feeling, hence why she became so attached to hunting with guns.

But, the decision came for the family to move to England, uprooting her incredibly cushy and lovely life in Canada. Their parents chose to send them to Hogwarts, even with the news of children dying, kids getting kidnapped, the train station being attacked, the insanity of the Ship and Carriage blowing up after the Tri-Wizard tournament. Hogwarts, somehow, was still considered a safe place. Nora doesn't think that's true, but she's actually rather pumped to go somewhere that bad things are happening. Maybe she can hunt real monsters.

She read about everything that had happened at Hogwarts, of course, and read it all again when their parents announced they would be moving there as soon as school ended this month in May. This Elaine Dupree, mass murderer and complete psycho, sounded just like the kind of monsters she had read about. She wonders whether Elaine is part demon, or just part crazy.

So Nora was brough to Hogwarts starting her sixth year, coincidentally right along with all the Americans that came from Ilvermorny. It was kind of an uneventful year as far as Hogwarts goes but... Azkaban prisoners were released that December, and that put everyone on Edge. Nora was pretty good at staying out of the more serious drama and just focusing on her studies, but of course her parents considered taking them back to Canada.&nbsp;

The summer after her sixth year was obnoxious. Quarantine started due to sickness, and that meant no going abroad. The big bad Elaine was killed, big deal and then... the Quidditch match explosion. Being a Quidditch player, Nora was pretty shooken up by that.&nbsp;

As far as her seventh year, Nora has been fascinated by the situation with the druids and wyrd magic. Nora loves new people and new things, so basically she's just been running around like a chicken with it's head cut off. She wants t learn about [i]everything[/i]/[/blockquote]
