[b style="color:black;font-family:georgia;font-size:10px;"]overall personality:[/b]
[blockquote style="color:black;font-family:georgia;font-size:10px;"]Arlo Bletchley thrives off people and always has. He is sociable and charming, and often seen as a bit of a golden boy. Prefect and Chaser for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, he likes to make himself appear to be the best. Though he doesn’t make it obvious he is massively self conscious and really does worry what people think of him. Well known amongst his more popular friend group, he likes to entertain and make people laugh, often trying to be the centre of attention. If the attention is not on him he’ll do something to draw attention to himself, foolish or not he Arlo doesn’t really mind. While his parents had carved out such legacies on the Slytherin Quidditch team and Prefect duties for their house they don’t exactly expect Arlo to do the same. However, Arlo has always put immense pressure on himself to do the same and live up to their (non-existent) expectations. He stresses himself out and suffers self-inflicted anxiety over achieving goals he has set from himself and maintaining peak performance. While he is intelligent in his academia, living up to his mother’s reputation he achieves good grades. But really he has all the common sense and social decorum of a goldfish, often putting his foot in it and sometimes getting himself in awkward situations. He lives on coffee, but really doesn’t need it. He’s very easily excitable and high energy even without the stimulant.

When he’s not keeping up appearances Arlo is a lot softer and can be more withdrawn. Although he thrives off people, sometimes even his social battery can be depleted. This is when he likes to hide away in the broom shed by the Quidditch pitch and read his comic books and graphic novels, or else indulge in one of his comfort Superhero movies. If not playing some of his video games. At heart Arlo is a comic book nerd and grew up reading, and sometimes even writing his own stories, although his art skills were always terrible he used to dream of publishing his own comic book. This side of himself Arlo tends to try to keep hidden, even trying and failing to hide it from his family. He worries that if people found out his fondness for all things Superhero, teamed with his studious nature that they’d bully him and call him a dork. The only one who really knows this side of him is his ‘baby sister. Georgie knows all about his secret passion and although sometimes she playfully teases him, she doesn’t really mean it. Arlo is fiercely protective of his ‘baby sister’ who is only 11 months his junior. They’ve grown up extremely close and remain so.

Despite his more social tendencies, since returning to school for his sixth year he is feeling the self imposed pressure and is feeling a little more lost and lonely than he previously had been. Although he thrives on his friends, he doesn’t really have any close confidants at the minute and is feeling it.

[b style="color:black;font-family:georgia;font-size:10px;"]history:[/b]
[blockquote style="color:black;font-family:georgia;font-size:10px;"]When Bryony King and Spencer Bletchley realised they were going to have a baby, they were nowhere near prepared. They had been living their young, free, socialite lives, and then Arlo happened. Though she doesn't regret it, Bryony never would have planned it like that. Each member’s of two Prominent Pureblood families, they had been sort of destined to find each other and fall in love. Celeste King, Bryony's Grandmother who raised her, had always said it was her biggest wish for Bryony to 'find a nice pureblood boy and settle down'. Although Bryony originally had other ideas, when she was a year Graduated from Hogwarts she met Spencer Bletchley at a Gala event and fell head over heels for him. Although he was five years her senior, she remembered him from school and the crush she had on him. And well the rest is history. Arlo came along after about a year and a half of dating and although they were shocked (out of wedlock!!), they were pleased.
 

Shortly after Arlo's birth they were married in a surprisingly low key affair, and a month after that they discovered Georgie was on the way. 


Despite the initial hiccups in their family planning, Bryony & Spencer have provided quite a stable, loving home for their children. Of course their financial security from their separate inheritances and the King Townhouse in Kensington helped with this, but still. Arlo and Georgie grew up in a caring home, devoid of the societal pressures that had once been placed on their parents. Although Bryony had been raised by her hell-heathen Grandmother and really had no idea how to be a mother, shockingly she made quite a good one. Doting on Arlo from day one, they've always had quite a special bond. Where Georgie was a daddy's girl, Arlo was quite definitely a Mummy's boy. Bryony ruled their house (with the help of a nanny) with a definite level of authority and set of rules, she has allowed her children to be mature and make their own decisions in life. Even if Arlo is far from mature. Leading to him mostly getting away with murder (within reason). Whilst Arlo feels expectations from his parents, sometimes working himself to the bone and stretching himself too thin over them, they actually have very little expectations for him. They felt the heavy weight of what their parents & guardians wanted from them, and they vowed to never do the same to their own children. In his heart Arlo just wants to make them proud. Which he has already done. He is studious and book smart, while still being easy going and sociable which made him a perfect choice for Prefect in his fifth year like his Mum. And while he didn't make Quidditch Captain like his father, he made the team all the same. He takes his Quidditch playing very seriously as an outlet for his high energy as well as a way to again, make his parents proud of him when they come to see him play. He enjoys his position of Chaser and has good camaraderie and relationships with everyone on the team.
 

He's not quite sure where it came from; but Arlo's secret love is in Comic books and all things Superhero. He had been sneaking off to the broom shed intermittently in his earlier years at Hogwarts to play his video games or indulge in his love of Superheros, but as the pressures of his later years became greater, so did his escapes. Although he is sociable and loves being around people, sometimes he just needs downtime that isn't in the Library or bustling common room. Especially as the common room has been a little busier as of late with the Ilvermorny transfers; mostly he doesn't mind them, and has found friends in a lot of them but sometimes it's just a little too busy for his liking.
 

Between Quidditch, studying and hiding Arlo leaves himself very little time to sleep and lives of Coffee in all forms. In reality it makes him jittery and even more hyper excited, but he deals with it. It does also worsen his anxiety and self-consciousness, but he tries to push that down and not think about it so much.


With regards to recent sit events he has been largely un-phased. If anything he has welcomed the Ilvermorny transfers. He was at the Wimbourne Wasps Vs Yorkshire match where there was 'firework malfunctions' with his father and some of his Quidditch bigwig co-workers in one of the private boxes. Although they were on the opposite side of the Stadium from the Ministry box, Arlo felt a level of survivors guilt. It very well could have happened to their box. He feels deep down there is more to the surface story of a firework malfunction, but he tries not to think too much on it when there's nothing he can do to change it. It has still left him a little bit shaken up. Returning for his sixth year after that, it was hard to not feel a little bit lost and lonely, but as always, he just sets his feelings aside and gets on with things.
