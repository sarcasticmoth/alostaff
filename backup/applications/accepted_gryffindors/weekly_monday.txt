[b]appearance:[/b]
[blockquote]Due to her goblin heritage, Monday is significantly shorter than most people and stands at just 4’10”. She has a curvy but petite build, with longer fingers and toes relative to typical proportions and a more angular facial structure. Her human ancestry, meanwhile, is Mexican-American, and she has a tan complexion and straight dark brown hair that reaches to the middle of her back. Her eyes, owing to her being part goblin, are darker than most (including her play-by), bordering on the black eyes typical of goblins.

Monday has her ears pierced once in each earlobe, in which she generally wears hoop earrings. She enjoys looking dressing up when not in her school uniform, though she tends to be one to bend the uniform regulations when she can get away with doing it.

As a consequence of her being part goblin, Monday is frailer than someone without expressed goblin genes would be. She has a tendency to dislocate her joints more than a non-goblin would, and she has to be careful to avoid activities which might cause her injury. Aside from the odd joint dislocation here and there, she has dealt with hip dysplasia for the majority of her life and is usually in a great deal of pain until she can get it treated.[/blockquote]

[b]boggart:[/b]
[blockquote]Monday most fears becoming profoundly injured in a way that cannot be easily fixed by magic. Second to that, she fears not being able to protect her siblings when they need her. [/blockquote]
[b]overall personality:[/b]
[blockquote][b]defensive[/b]

Though she might not look threatening because of her size—and might not be the most willing to duel someone due to the risk of physical injury it would pose to her—Monday is a defensive person. It has become her default setting with those she doesn’t know, especially where her siblings are concerned. She knows that she and more than a few of her siblings have faced discrimination due to factors beyond their control, and she isn’t about to let anyone get away with that. She tries not to have a short fuse, but it happens on occasion.

[b]devoted[/b]

Even though she has her moments, Monday is a very loving person. She cares for her siblings more than just about anything in the world and would do anything for them. If any of them are in a rut, she’ll find a way to help them out of it and ensure that they’re alright again.

[b]intelligent[/b]

Partly because of her goblin heritage, Monday is very intelligent. She has always been able to pick up information quickly and put it to use, though she gets bored of doing things like reading for pleasure if she doesn’t have an explicit purpose for it.

[b]careful[/b]

While she isn’t a hypochondriac, Monday is very cautious to avoid anything that might cause her injury or illness. This means that activities such as Quidditch, Quodpot, and dueling are off the table, and she has to make sure not to over-exert herself in other activities. She doesn’t enjoy being a buzzkill in that regard, but she is mindful of her limitations.

[b]playful[/b]

Monday enjoys having a good time, even if she has to ensure that she’s not exceeding her limits. Whether it’s a night in or a night out, she’ll try to find a way to make it fun. She knows when things need to be treated more seriously and when they don’t, and she has no difficulty in livening up a room full of people.

[b]snobby[/b]

Although wholly unintentional on her part, Monday can be slightly snobby. She has spent essentially her entire life as the eldest daughter of two celebrities, so she is a little bit out of touch with reality at times. While she understands that money can’t buy happiness, being able to rely upon her parents’ fortunes has kept her comfortable, and she has a tendency to forget that non-famous people don’t necessarily have the same resources and opportunities that she does.

[b]history:[/b]
[blockquote]At birth, the infant who would become known as Monday Weekly was known merely as "Baby Girl Trevino". Her birth mother believed herself to be the carrier of a blood malediction and gave her infant up for adoption upon learning that she was female and therefore likely to have inherited the curse. The newborn baby was much smaller than was typical, though it was found after a great deal of testing that she did not have a blood curse at all. Rather, the Healers determined that she had signs of goblin heritage, though how far back it extended was difficult to ascertain.

This was no deterrent for April and August Weekly, a celebrity couple who were childless at the time. They happily sought to adopt [i]three[/i] unrelated children, who would become known as Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Monday and Tuesday had received their names because Wednesday had been so named by her birth mother, and it seemed to be serendipitous: They would have two daughters (Monday and Wednesday) and a son (Tuesday), all around the same age.

While Monday and Wednesday were successfully adopted, the birth mother of the infant meant to be Tuesday Weekly chose not to terminate her parental rights in the end. This dampened the Weekly family's spirits slightly, though their two daughters weren't their only children for long. After them, in short succession, came a biological daughter, Charlie, and two more adopted children named—what else?—Thursday and Friday, both about Charlie's age.

Were they an unusual family? Without a doubt, considering that each adopted child was different from most others in magical society in some way, and the notability and wealth of their parents made for an interesting upbringing—fad diets, current trends, rumors. Always aware of her differences but never made to feel ashamed of them, Monday learned how to navigate her way through life as a part-goblin witch.

Her childhood, though eclectic, was happy. Monday did not want for much, and even the limitations that she faced due to being part goblin were bearable, for the most part. She learned how to support her younger siblings' varying needs, and she took the role of being the oldest seriously. (Okay, so maybe she could be a little bit bossy, too, but she meant well.)

Around the time that Monday was about nine years old, her parents adopted two more children. They were both younger than she, though only by about two years. The two boys were given the names Saturday and Sunday. They, too, were welcomed into the family with open arms.

Eventually, at around age eleven, both she and Wednesday went off to Ilvermorny. While Monday was apprehensive about being so far across the country from the rest of their family, she was relieved to have been picked by both Horned Serpent and Thunderbird, the latter of which she chose to enter. Wednesday also became a Thunderbird, which made adjusting to life at school even easier.

In their first year at Ilvermorny, their parents decided to adopt one of their classmates and they had cemented their family of ten with a Tuesday. School became more enjoyable for Monday as the rest of her siblings began to attend Ilvermorny in the years that followed. Their family might have been unusual to some people, but Monday was quick to ensure that her younger siblings had the supports that they needed. Aside from the inevitable health struggles that came with being part goblin, Monday genuinely enjoyed school—and she came away with the grades to show for it.

The damage that was done to Ilvermorny following her fifth year was a shock, though Monday was grateful to be able to go to Hogwarts instead. It was farther from their parents, sure, but she never really had to consider it. Their parents had no shortage of money and other resources, so it wasn't as though they wouldn't be able to see them any less than when they were at Ilvermorny.

The tension present upon starting at a new school was greater than Monday had expected, and she found that it was more difficult to fit in amongst the British students than she had anticipated. She was the adopted part-goblin daughter of a famous family, and she had begun to feel it for the first time. She was put in Gryffindor House, though she was determined not to let the dynamics between her and her siblings change because of how their Houses had shifted.

Gradually, Hogwarts life became more bearable—even fun, at times—but things turned from bad to worse. Monday was thankful not to have been caught up as dragons descended upon Hogsmeade, then—the next thing she knew—Azkaban was destroyed and even MACUSA was having to provide foreign aid. Then, just as summer approached alongside hopes of being able to go home to California, Hag's Fever and the quarantine intended to contain it hit.

Given her goblin heritage, Monday knew that she had to be more careful than most. Knowing that the condition would be more severe for her, she began to withdraw from many of her peers, using a Bubble-Head Charm when she had to be around large numbers of people.

She was even more relieved to be going back to her own home—or a property that her parents had purchased for her and her siblings' use—in lieu of going to the orphanage like so many of their peers. Aside from the trauma that she knew it would cause some of her siblings to be in that environment, it also reduced the chances that she would catch Hag's Fever. Spending her summer avoiding illness wasn't in Monday's plans, but she knew that she didn't really have a choice.[/blockquote]
[b]site events reaction:[/b]
[blockquote]While at Ilvermorny, Monday was never overly concerned about anything that happened in the United Kingdom. She never really had reason to be, and her life was entirely in the United States. The issues that Hogwarts and the Ministry of Magic faced, while understandably bad, didn’t really cross her radar because she had other things to worry about.

That changed completely, however, when Ilvermorny was damaged and closed to its students indefinitely just after they had left school for the summer. Going to Hogwarts was the option extended to all who wanted and were able to take it, as Monday and her siblings did. All of the murders and tragedy and discrimination that she had brushed off before became that much more serious to her now that she and the rest of her family were likely to be affected by them.

As nervous as she was to go to Hogwarts in the middle of the chaos, she knew that she wasn’t going there alone. She had her siblings with her, and they would be able to get through whatever the world threw at them. That that would end up being escaped dragons and then convicts, on the other hand, was alarming. Taking into consideration their parents’ high profiles, the thought of dealing with a ton of prison escapees was hardly reassuring to Monday. The few months of quiet that would inevitably precede another major disruption were okay, but then came Hag’s Fever.

Knowing how dangerous it might be for her to catch Hag’s Fever, Monday spent the remainder of the school year in relative isolation to limit her exposure to it as much as she could. It was tiring for her after about the first week of dealing with it, but being hospitalized for part of the summer didn’t sound like her idea of a good time.[/blockquote]
