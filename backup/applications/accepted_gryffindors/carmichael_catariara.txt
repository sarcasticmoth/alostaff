[b]appearance:[/b]
[blockquote]	Cats is 5"8 and not done growing yet. The women in her family all tend to be very tall. She's muscular and tan from living an outdoors lifestyle. Her face looks exactly like her mother's. Round, sharp cheekbones, a strong well defined jaw, a plump mid-sized nose, and big bright blue eyes.

She has her father's medium brown hair and it's just a little bit curly naturally, but she generally uses magic to keep it straight. In the face she looks strikingly similar to her mother. The only real difference being that her smile is exactly her biological father's. She also takes after his body type.

Cats' mum is very thin with long legs, but Cats is of average build and her legs are proportionally average to her body, but she has a bit of a long torso which can make her legs look short. She's thankful she has a very slim waist. Cats' also has broad shoulders (makes jacket shopping a real pain!) and when she flexes her muscles they look much larger than they do at rest.

Cats' is a jock so it's not uncommon to catch her rocking athletic wear. But she takes a lot of pride in her appearance and even her athletic trackies and gym shorts are color coordinated with her racerback sports bras and crew socks.Her every day wear involves lots of mini skirts, sequins, and funky tees with funny graphics on them.[/blockquote]

Catsie excels in courses that require less practical knowledge. Her instincts help her a great deal in courses like Defense Against the Dark Arts and her upbringing has always given her an advantage in Herbology.[/blockquote]

[b]overall personality:[/b]
[blockquote]
Catsie loves being around other people and not just in the same room. She wants to have lots of positive interactions with those around her. She's also very reckless, though. This can make her both fun to be around, but also overwhelming. She's the personality type who doesn't always know when to leave well enough alone. She usually has good intentions, though.

On a good day she's an excellent communicator. You'll never have to wonder what is on Catsie's mind because she will just tell you. On a bad day she'll tear you apart with her words and leave you feeling like you aren't worth anything. Being so expressive does mean she can be bad at concealing her feelings. Wearing her heart on her sleeve gets her easily taken advantage of more often than she'd like to admit.

People who do take advantage of her naivety are in for a rude awakening, though. Cats is a hot head and if she thinks you've earned her anger she'll take the opportunity to take it out on you. Even if whatever you did isn't worth the amount of anger you're receiving. Those moments are rare, though. But it's not out of the ordinary for Cats to be aggressive.

For those who can roll with her chaotic nature and get her to admit she can be a bit much sometimes she's a passionate friend. She's loyal, she's good at keeping other peoples' secrets, and she's quick to defend you (verbally and physically). She's the life of the party! She just doesn't always know when the party is over. She has no idea what she wants to do with her life and as an impulsive and reckless person she'll probably jump into a profession she regrets soon after graduation.[/blockquote]

[div align="center"][font size="5"]personal history[/font][/div][hr]
[b]origins:[/b]
[blockquote][b]Keswick, Cumbria
West Lake District, England[/b]

Cats was born and raised in Keswick, giving her a thick Cumbrian accent that she's a bit embarrassed of. She tries to hide it the way her mother does, but her attempts aren't nearly as successful. Cats is, however, easier to understand than her younger siblings whose accents make Catsie's seem tame. She tries her best to help them sound more mainstream.[/blockquote]
[b]relations:[/b]
[blockquote][b]Barrett Acelin Carmichael[/b], b. 1993. Catsie's mother is tall, blonde, very thin, and stoic. She's a mean-spirited person who delights from seeing others suffer. She's musically gifted and has always used her musical talents to make money. After graduating Hogwats she continued a fling she had with a fellow Gryffindor, unaware that her parents had run background checks on him. Or that they even knew about him. Cats' mum worried about how to tell him, but he was a womanizer. He got bored of her mum before she started showing and she never had to tell him. A few months before Cats was born her mum moved to Keswick to avoid her parents' scrutiny. Also to avoid running into Catsie's father or anyone who may know him. She supplemented her income from musical tutoring by moonlighting as a burglar. She gave that up after her marriage to Richard.

[b]Brett Katz[/b], b. 1994. Catsie's biological father is extroverted, handsome, and very playful. He currently works for Magical Law Enforcement after failing out of the auror academy. He's a relentless womaniser who Cats' mum believes probably wouldn't remember her even if he had her face tattooed on him.

[b]Richard "Rick" Currer Cornwell-Carmichael[/b] b. 1987. Cats' papa is a handsome and charismatic pragmatist. Rick's first year at Hogwarts was in 1998 when the Ministry of Magic had fallen into the hands of Death Eaters. His parents, aunts, uncles, and grandparents were all working at the Ministry of Magic before, during, and after the takeover. The Cornwells are "purebloods" meaning they've been pure long enough that it's hard to question their lineage, but their name isn't considered prestigious. Rick's family at the ministry of magic were secretly helping muggleborns during the war so they avoided trials after Voldemort's second fall. Rick grew up wanting to help the way they had and eventually became a healer. He is prominent at St. Mungo's and is in charge of the hospital's Community Outreach Committee.

[b]Aurel-Richard Vadim Carmichael[/b] Cats' younger brother by 10 years. He's hyper and adorable. Cats thinks of him as more of a puppy than a brother. Their grandparents treat him like he's the answer to their prayers just because he's a boy.

[b]Carline Rhiannon Carmichael[/b] Cats' younger sister by 11 years. Cats loves her, but thinks the way she deadpan stares at things/people is creepy. Absolutely stunningly gorgeous, though. She looks like a total doll baby and will let you dress her up like one without fussing or ruining the outfits.

[b]Celie and Doru Carmichael[/b] Cats' maternal grandparents. They've been very hands on in dealing with Cats and her siblings. They don't want any of them to go down the "wrong path" like Catsie's mum.

[b]Mattias Aleister Carmichael[/b] Cats' uncle. Her mum's big brother and best friend. He was Cats' mum's partner when she was working as a burglar. He's been involving in robbery and smuggling since he was a teen. It started small, sneaking contraband prank items between his contacts at Durmstrang and Beauxbatons when he was a student. Now he mostly deals in stolen art and jewels, though he can still be persuaded to make a path for the occasional ancient artifact. He's Celie and Doru's unproblematic golden boy.

[b]Ion Carmichael[/b] Ion is brothers with Cats' grandfather Doru. He's the one who first gave Cats' mum connections when she was entering the underground world of burglary. He has one son that he dotes on and spoils: Eddie.

[b]Eddie Carmichael[/b] "Uncle" Eddie. Former Ravenclaw. Much older than his cousin: Cats' mum Barrett. Cats loves her Uncle Eddie. He brings the best presents during holidays.

[b]Isolde Lavinia and Triton Arion Cornwell[/b] Cats' paternal grandparents. Papa Rick's parents. They stopped pretending to care about blood purity after Voldemort's second fall and used their positions in the ministry to forge paperwork to help muggleborns hide during the war. They're the stereotypical sweet and caring grandparents. Isolde still works at the ministry of magic. Triton has already retired from his post at the ministry.

[b]Amber Rhiannon Cornwell[/b], b. 1993. Cats' favorite aunt, her Papa Rick's favorite cousin, and her mum's nemesis from school. There's a lot of animosity between Amber and her mum, but they pretend to be civil whenever the children are around.[/blockquote]

[b]history:[/b]
[blockquote]Cats spent the majority of her earliest years (before the age of five) in the floo networks. She would pop between her grandparents' small castle in France and her mother's modest cottage in Keswick. She went to school in Keswick, was raised playing with muggle children, and even attended muggle day programs and play dates. Twice a year for holidays she would spend a month in France with her grandparents. She would also spend a few days at a time if her mother was doing a long job.

Despite her mother going through a brief stint as a cat burglar during this time (she fancied herself a witchy Robin Hood), Catsie had a very normal, positive, and supportive upbringing. Her mum introduced her to her boyfriend when Cats was five. Cats was a total daddy's girl straight from the moment they met.

Cats' biological father is a man she has never met or even seen a photo of. She thinks she once heard her mum's cousin Eddie say his name was Fred. Her mother's parents ensured his family was pure enough for Catsie's mother when she was seeing him, but disregarded him as a serious partner for her mum. When Catsie's mum got pregnant by him only a year out of Hogwarts she told her family she had gotten a job and relocated to Keswick where she hid Catsie from her parents until she eventually married Catsie's "papa," Richard.

After the wedding Richard took the surname Carmichael since their family was more prominent than his. The Cornwells are questionably pure, but enough so that Catsie's grandparents didn't try to break them up. They figured it was a miracle their "ruined" daughter got married to a decent bloke at all. Whenever Catsie asks about her biological father her mum or grandparents won't give her a name or a straight answer.

Her mum repeats some version of 'he was a nice guy, but not ready to be a father,' and leaves it at that. While her mum's parents have much harsher things to say about him. Juvenile, immature, reckless, loser, and bum are words they use a lot when he's the topic. Unbeknownst to Cats or her mum, her mum's parents keep up with his life and what he's doing. They're thoroughly unimpressed and glad their daughter never admitted to them who he is.

Papa Rick and Cats' mum married when Cats was 7 and Papa adopted her the year after that. Her life didn't change much after the marriage except for the number of people she lived with. Rick moved into the cottage and by the time Cats was headed off to Hogwarts her parents had already had two more children. The cottage was only two bedrooms and an attic. Cats' voluntarily moved into the attic because she wanted her own space away from the smaller kids, but she usually spends more time camping in the woods around the cottage.

She went to Hogwarts nervous, but optimistic. She didn't hesitate to sit under the sorting hat and she opened herself up to lots of new adventures. She made a ton of great friends, too. It wasn't until her third year that the mysterious murders started. Later it would be revealed it had all been done by the Purifiers, but during that time Cats' family wasn't sure how to go about things. She was young so they decided Hogwarts was still the best place for her. People were dying both in and out of the castle so it was better she be where she could learn to defend herself.

And it would turn out those skills would come in handy sooner rather than later. She was late for school the next year (looking for a particular hair accessory she didn't want to go to school without) and was at King's Cross when the Purifiers attacked. Fortunately she and her whole family (who were there to see her off) made it out without a scratch.

These events made her a very serious and determined young lady. She's still joyful and playful, but she works harder than she did before especially in her classes. She's also taken up physical defense lessons and has been practicing her wandless magic in case she is disarmed in a dangerous situation. She doesn't want to be helpless again. This drive can sometimes seem intense, but a desire to workout rather than go to Hogsmeade saved her from being there on the day of the dragon attack.

Cats' is halfway through her sixth year and totally disillusioned with the world. She's rolling with the punches and reminding herself that no one's ever ready to face a Kraken attack or an escaped Azkaban convict. She's frustrated with her mother for not telling her more about her biological father, but she doesn't want her papa to feel like he isn't enough. She resents her grandparents for their views that she feels are backwards about muggles, but they're her [i]grandparents[/i] and she loves them. She wants to be a good big sister, but doesn't think she's responsible enough to be a decent role model for Aurel-Richard and Carline.

She's a mixed bag of emotions at the moment and for the last year or so has taken to lashing out. Her professors have had to send more than one letter home to her parents which is surprising because despite her rambunctious nature she's never been disrespectful or disruptive before now.[/blockquote]
