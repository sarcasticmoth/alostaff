[b]overall personality:[/b]
[blockquote][b]distrustful[/b]
Chrissy has had no shortage of adults come in and out of her life since her abduction and her parents’ murders. While she is generally more comfortable around witches and wizards than those who are non-magical—fearing that the latter will harm her the way her captors had—she is still wary of most people and their motives. She doesn’t want to end up in another situation like the one she has been in already, and she will do her best to avoid that.

[b]self-reliant[/b]
Because she has been bounced around quite a bit since her parents died, Chrissy has had to rely on herself more than anyone around her. She’s mature for her age—mostly because she was forced to be—and is reluctant to ask for help when she really does need it.

[b]quiet[/b]
Chrissy is also quiet. She doesn’t like talking about her abduction or the fact that her parents are dead, and she has a tendency to shut down completely if the topic is brought up around her. She isn’t one to speak up—even in class—and would prefer to blend into the background, unnoticed.

[b]fearful[/b]
Because of what the Second Salemers who abducted her put her through, Chrissy has a lot of residual trauma that she still needs to work her way through. She tenses up at sounds that wouldn’t make others blink, and she always has to check to make sure that she’s not being followed or that she might end up trapped. 

[b]courageous[/b]
Even though she doesn’t see herself as such and would vehemently deny it, Chrissy is certainly courageous. She has been through more than most people her own age—never mind those decades older than she—and managed to survive despite the horrific abuse of her captors.

[b]persevering[/b]
In spite of the tragedies and setbacks in her young life, Chrissy has remained persevering. Although she may feel momentarily stuck or hopeless, she has kept going, determined to make it out the other side and honor the memory of her late parents.

[b]history:[/b]
[blockquote]Chrysanthemum Crawford was born and raised in Pasadena, California, outside of Los Angeles, to middle-class wizarding parents. They lived normal lives—as far as the magical world was concerned, anyway. There was nothing that was particularly remarkable about the Crawfords, in truth. They made their livings and sent their daughter to a magical homeschool co-op so that she would have friends her age.

It was nothing, in other words, for Gaia and Corey Crawford to be criminalized for, except where the New Salem Philanthropic Society was concerned. Although they were wary of the presence of witch-hunters, the Crawfords were—like many other witches and wizards—careful not to expose the magical world to outsiders. They had done nothing wrong, though, somehow, they managed to arouse the suspicions of a few local members of the New Salem Philanthropic Society, who posed as No-Maj students raising money for a trip in order to scope out the property.

If Gaia and Corey had known that they were targets, they would have moved or gone into hiding—whatever they had to do to ensure their safety and that of their daughter. They were never given that opportunity.

On July 4, 2020, after nearly all of the night's fireworks displays had ended, witch-hunters managed to break into the Crawford family home. Hearing the commotion, Gaia and Corey awoke and, realizing who the “burglars” were too late, were killed before they could ever defend themselves in the resulting scuffle. 

The young witch-hunters took what they could from the property, making their way upstairs to where Chrissy stirred in her bedroom, awoken by the noise. Recalling the little girl that they had seen while pretending to be a couple of high schoolers in need of some extra cash,  the inexperienced witch-hunters panicked: With the child's parents dead, they couldn’t just leave her there as a witness to their crimes.

Chrissy's only memory of the night was seeing two figures who were clearly not her parents entering her bedroom, binding her arms and legs with tape so that she could not fight back, and covering her mouth  so that she could not scream. Barely ten years old and unable to control her magical abilities, Chrissy was terrified.
While they didn’t really know what to do with the girl, she was also just a kid. They could have killed her—and momentarily considered it—but they already had two dead bodies on their hands… and could they live with themselves for killing a little girl? Desperate not to screw up any more than they had, they carried her off into the night. 

It wasn't until after she was rescued that she learned that the place she had been driven to by her captors was on the outskirts of Soledad, also in California—a far cry away from the life she had known. There, in a secluded home on a large piece of property, she was kept for the next four months. Held captive there with the belief that her parents were still alive, she was subjected to all manner of torture and neglect while her captors figured out what they were supposed to do with a ten-year-old with no control over her magical abilities.

Meanwhile, back in Pasadena, the Crawford family's friends and neighbors in the magical community became increasingly concerned when they had not heard from the couple or their daughter. Rightly, they alerted MACUSA, which discovered the bodies of Gaia and Corey—deceased with clear defensive wounds—but not their young child. A hunt for Chrysanthemum "Chrissy" Crawford was soon launched across the state and then the region. Although she was ten, she didn't have control over her magic, and the government felt that there was enough of a risk that, if not already dead, she could become an Obscurial.

Eventually, Chrissy’s captors slipped up, accidentally mentioning the little girl to an undercover Auror. They lead the MACUSA investigative to Soledad and the home where Chrissy had been kept virtually imprisoned. A few days after Thanksgiving, Chrissy was recovered—alive—and her captors arrested on multiple charges.

Chrissy was taken to the nearest magical hospital, where she was treated for the abuse and malnutrition that she had suffered. Also of importance was figuring out who the girl's next of kin was, as her parents had died intestate. Realizing that her parents were really dead was a shock, and Chrissy was distraught over their passing.

Once she was released from the hospital, she was temporarily placed in the care of one of the other magical families in the area. As a victim of a child abduction and a ward of MACUSA, however, her life became increasingly complicated. She had no family of her own and was bounced around when necessary, never getting attached to anywhere or anything for too long.

Like other children her age, Chrissy was sent to Ilvermorny at the age of eleven, where she was Sorted into Pukwudgie. Although she was nervous to be in yet another new environment, she was also happy that she wouldn't have to leave this one so soon. She occasionally got some strange looks and comments from her peers who realized who she was, and she spent more time hiding in the bathroom than she cared to admit.

Ilvermorny, though, was the safest place that Chrysanthemum Crawford had known. She cried upon receiving her wand, in fact, overjoyed that she could use magic without the fear of being harmed for it. While insecure about her abilities, she began to flourish at the school, where she was happy to spend her time until the summer and wherever she would get placed for its duration.

Life continued that way, fortunately less eventful than it once had. There were problems elsewhere in the world, but Chrissy only ever focused on what was happening in her life. It wasn't that she was selfish, but she had to keep her guard up… just in case.

What scared her the most was the news that students from Hogwarts, the British wizarding school, had been kidnapped and killed. Chrissy had a difficult time processing that, knowing how they must have felt and worrying that her own death was imminent. Her grades suffered considerably, and—the more she learned about the happenings in Britain—she felt completely lost.

Fortunately, she was far enough away from all of that that it wouldn't affect her, and Chrissy gradually became comfortable again. And then the Triwizard Tournament happened. She hadn't been following it, really, but the news of the explosions shook her.

Safely back at another foster home, Chrissy was trying to find some sense of calm again when the news about Ilvermorny itself came. Never since her abduction and rescue had her world come crashing down so quickly. Her school, her wand, and the one place where she had been truly safe to be herself had to be taken away from her, too.

When the offer was extended for Ilvermorny students to attend Hogwarts, Chrissy was hesitant to even mention it. She had heard so many things about how dangerous Hogwarts was, but she also didn't want to miss out on going to school. It wouldn't have been so complicated if her parents were still alive, but it was up to MACUSA to decide.

While the magical government figured out all of her paperwork, Chrissy sat around and waited. She kept on waiting, with no real progress whenever she would check to see what was happening. First, she was told that it would come. Then, she was told that she would get a tutor to catch her up on what her classmates were learning halfway around the world. The tutor rarely came on time, though, leaving Chrissy on pins and needles.

Another Christmas came without her parents, and it was only with the news that Azkaban had fallen that Chrissy got some good news for a change: She would be able to attend Hogwarts.

At first, it sounded like a joke. All of this, and she would actually get to go midway through the school year? It was true. One of the MACUSA investigators who had helped to rescue her as a ten-year-old, Alyra Pond, would be going over to the United Kingdom to help their magical government in its investigation on the destruction of Azkaban and had offered to be her temporary guardian while she had to attend Hogwarts.

Gratefully, Chrissy packed her belongings and set off for Hogwarts, where she was Sorted into Gryffindor House. She began attending classes with the Hogwarts students and her former Ilvermorny classmates, though she knew that she was woefully behind in most of the material they were covering. To keep her from suffering socially, it was decided that she would stay with her own year group for the time being, with the understanding that she would almost certainly have to repeat her fourth year.

While it was a slight setback, Chrissy was glad to be back at school. Hogwarts seemed more dangerous than Ilvermorny ever had, but at least there was more predictability than she had known for months. She's still trying to deal with her past trauma and feel truly safe, and she hopes that she'll find that eventually.

[b]site events reaction:[/b]
[blockquote]More than anything, the events of the past few years—in America and abroad—triggered a lot of emotions in Chrissy about her past experiences. The Hogwarts kidnappings of April 1, 2023, for her, was probably one of the worst, as it hit very close to home and her memories of her own abduction.

Second to that was, without a doubt, the vandalism done to Ilvermorny. The school was the only place where Chrissy had been able to feel safe, and the damage done to it deeply affected her, as well as its effect on her ability to continue her education for quite a while.

While Chrissy is wary about being in Britain after so many bad things have happened there, she knows that she wouldn't be at Hogwarts at the moment without what had happened to Azkaban. Although she is worried about the criminals who might have escaped from prison, she plans to stick close to the new MACUSA presence.[/blockquote]
